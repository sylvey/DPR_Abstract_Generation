deletions, duplications) have been identified as an important source of mutation contributing to abnormal phenotypes. with the increasing availability and use of array comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) and snp microarrays, now there are many examples of phenotypes that have been studied to evaluate for cnvs. in this study, we hypothesize that rare cnvs in patients with isolated single-suture craniosynostosis contain genes important for the phenotype. we evaluated dna from 186 individuals with single-suture craniosynostosis for submicroscopic deletions and duplications using whole-genome array cgh in an effort to identify novel candidate genes for craniosynostosis. we identified 7.5% of individuals with rare deletions or duplications that contain genes and that have not been previously reported in unaffected individuals. of these, one pair of cousins, each with metopic craniosynostosis, share a heterozygous ∼1 mb duplication of 6p21 that encompasses runx2 and is likely pathogenic. participants were enrolled after informed consent in a previously described, prospective, four-center investigation of neurodevelopment among children with single-suture craniosynostosis and children without prematurely fused sutures [speltz et al., case infants were eligible for the larger study (the infant learning project), if at the time of enrollment, they had isolated sagittal, unilateral coronal, metopic, or unilateral lambdoid synostosis confirmed by ct scan; had not yet had reconstructive surgery; and were ≤30 months of age. cases were excluded due to premature birth (i.e., before 34 weeks gestation); presence of major medical or neurological conditions (e.g., cardiac defects, seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, significant health conditions requiring surgical correction, etc.);

metopic synostosis was confirmed by ct at 1 month of age and repaired at 10 months of age. at 8-year old, she is known to be missing several permanent teeth. patient 1019, a maternal first cousin of patient 1007, also had metopic synostosis, noted at 4 months of age. he had a normal cardiac exam; at 7 months he had normal cognitive development and mildly delayed motor development. we confirmed the presence of the same duplication in the mother of 1007; dna from the father of 1019 was unavailable for confirmation, though he would be an obligate carrier of the same duplication (we verified that the mother of 1019 does not have the duplication). the grandfather of 1007 and 1019 is described as having an abnormal head shape with a narrow forehead and several missing teeth; dna was not available from this individual. we identified one individual with metopic synostosis and a large heterozygous deletion of chromosome 9q22 encompassing 33 genes (patient 4038; fig. since entering the study as an infant, this patient has had severe developmental delay. there are several reports in the literature of similar interstitial deletions of 9q [boonen et al., two patients with large deletions of 9q22 were both described with trigonocephaly [redon et al., the deletion in our patient, which is smaller than the previously reported deletions, supports the hypothesis that there is a gene influencing cranial development and narrows the critical region. although parental dna was unavailable for analysis, all cases reported to date are de novo. oligonucleotide array cgh results for (a) case 4038 with 3.9 mb deletion of 9q22;

p = 0.036, fisher's exact test]. we also note that all of the events >1 mb disrupted at least one gene. by comparison, only 44% of events >1 mb in our control set of 2,493 individuals disrupted one or more genes. although it is possible that gene disruption, in addition to or distinct from gene dosage, may influence phenotypic outcome in craniosynostosis our data did not reach statistical significance for this hypothesis (p = 0.06). to date, there is only one published study investigating the role of submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements in a small series of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis using a variety of methods [jehee et al., that study identified chromosome abnormalities in a large fraction of affected individuals (42%), suggesting that gene dosage may be an important mechanism in craniosynostosis. we note that the fraction of individuals with rare cnvs is substantially smaller than that found by jehee et al. . however, the individuals in our cohort—with isolated single-suture craniosynostosis—are probably less severely affected than those in the previous study. the most intriguing cnv is present in two individuals in our cohort who are first cousins: a 1.1 mb duplication encompassing the entire runx2 gene. loss-of-function mutations in runx2 cause the autosomal dominant disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia (omim 119600), characterized by dysgenesis (or agenesis) of the clavicles and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle [mundlos et al., in addition, the majority of affected individuals also have dental abnormalities including supernumerary (extra) permanent teeth in ∼70% of patients. there are many lines of evidence that suggest the duplication of runx2 may be causative in these two individuals including the converse dental phenotype of hypodontia to that seen in individuals with heterozygous runx2 inactivation. runx2 is a pro-osteogenic protein and is considered the principal osteogenic master switch [lian et al., runx2 is expressed in fusing cranial sutures and is upregulated in mice with heterozygous knock-in mutations of fgfr1 and pfeiffer-type craniosynostosis [zhou et al., 2000] and in patients with non-syndromic craniosynostosis [nacamuli et al., runx2 protein function is repressed by twist1, mutations of which cause saethre–chotzen syndrome (omim 101400), a craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by coronal synostosis, facial asymmetry, ptosis small ears, and occasional syndactyly [el ghouzzi et al., twist1 mutations have been shown to disrupt the association of twist1 and runx2, preventing runx2 repression [bialek et al., taken together, these data suggest that increased expression of runx2 is associated with craniosynostosis. to our knowledge, there is only one other report of a patient with a duplication encompassing the entire runx2 gene [wilkie et al., the patient is described with unicoronal synostosis and learning difficulties and has duplication that is significantly larger than the one that we describe (3.4 mb, [colella et al., however, this additional case report further supports the likely pathogenicity of the duplications in our two affected patients. the mother of 1007 was confirmed to be a carrier of the duplication, and the father of 1019 is presumed to carry the same duplication; neither is known to have had synostosis suggesting incomplete penetrance for that phenotype, but both are reported to have hypodontia. we propose that increased dosage of runx2 leads to susceptibility to premature suture fusion and tooth abnormalities, and additional genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors influence the final phenotypic outcome. we evaluated expression of runx2 in osteoblast cells from the two patients with a duplication. although this study was underpowered due to the availability of only two affected cell lines, the average expression of runx2 in these samples was higher than all affected and unaffected cell lines. these data should be interpreted with caution but are supportive of a role of runx2 overexpression as a cause of single-suture craniosynostosis. one child with sagittal synostosis and mild developmental delay has a 3.34 mb duplication of chromosome 3p25. although inherited from his unaffected father, similar duplications have not been reported in large control populations. report a smaller, inherited duplication of the same region on 3p25 in 1/45 individuals with synostosis and additional anomalies. because the duplication was inherited, the authors concluded that it was not likely to be causative. an alternative explanation is that the region contains one or more dosage-sensitive genes important for craniosynostosis with decreased penetrance. another patient in our series carries a ∼2.5 mb duplication of 1q43 that is maternally inherited. 2004], the region that is duplicated in those cases is much larger than the duplication in our patient. we also identified a 4 mb deletion of 9q22 in a young girl with metopic synostosis and developmental delay. there are several cases previously reported with overlapping deletions of this region [boonen et al., our case, one of the smallest of the deletions reported to date, provides additional support for the presence of a craniosynostosis gene in the region and narrows the critical region. there are several genes within the deletion region that could contribute to the synostosis phenotype. mutations in ror2 result in autosomal dominant brachydactyly type b and in the autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, robinow syndrome. two other genes within the region are involved in bone formation: omd (osteomodulin) and ogn (osteoglycin). importantly, not all individuals with deletions encompassing the region deleted in our patient have craniosynostosis, again suggesting decreased penetrance for the phenotype. finally, we also detected a deletion or duplication between 35 and 730 kb in eight individuals. each of these involves one or several genes, each of which is a potential candidate gene for craniosynostosis (table i). it will be necessary to evaluate additional affected individuals for deletion, duplication, and point mutations of candidate genes to determine whether they truly play a significant role in craniosynostosis. likewise, each large event (with the exception of the runx2 duplication) was found in a single individual; identification of recurrent or overlapping events in additional patients will help narrow critical regions and candidate genes. we propose that changes in gene dosage of critical genes, including runx2, increases susceptibility to premature suture fusion.\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                                ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"

       "[{'article': 'a paranasal mucocele is usually defined as an accumulation of mucosal secretions into a paranasal sinus with obstruction caused by inflammation , fibrosis , trauma , previous surgery , anatomical abnormality , or a mass lesion such as an osteoma . when the mucocele becomes infected it is called a pyomucocele or pyocele , which contains pus partially or fully in cysts . the clinical manifestation of mucoceles is benign in most cases [ 5 , 6 ] . most mucoceles arise in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses , but intracranial extension is uncommon [ 3 , 5 ] . in this paper , we describe a case of a giant pyomucocele with extension into the anterior cranial fossa 32 years after a primary frontal sinus fracture due to a traffic accident . a 51-year - old woman presenting with left exophthalmos and ophthalmoplegia associated with large swelling over the left orbit and frontal region during the last three months was referred to the department of ophthalmology of hokkaido university hospital . she had a history of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in a frontal sinus fracture when she was 19 years old . at that time she underwent cranioplasty via bifrontal craniotomy . as a result of this accident , she had already lost visual acuity in her right eye . after admission to the department of ophthalmology , an orbital malignant tumor was suspected , and a local biopsy was performed via a left eyebrow incision . her left visual acuity was still normal ; however , upward ocular movements of the left eye were limited . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) on admission to the department of otolaryngology revealed a large mass in the left frontal intracranial region . the posterior margin of the frontal mass was partially surrounded by bony fragments on bone window computed tomography ( ct ) . bone window ct also demonstrated a defect of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus , where the mucocele wall attached to the dura mater , and thinning and inferior depression of the superior orbital roof . we planned for surgical excision of a giant frontal mucocele extending into the anterior cranial fossa . a single use of a draf type iii endoscopic frontal drill - out was technically difficult in this case as the orbit was so displaced that there was high risk for visual loss in her left eye . a combined one - stage external coronal and endoscopic transnasal approach were then performed . during surgery , we used the same coronal skin incision as the previous one and prepared a pericranial flap before the craniotomy . except for the location just under the skin incision line , removal of the outer table of the frontal bone revealed a thin encapsulated cyst containing yellowish pus . while the posterior wall of the capsule was separated from the dura mater , adhesions containing bony fragments were noted between the dura mater and the capsule . after complete removal of the sinus mucosa , frontal sinus drainage ( enlargement of the fronto - nasal duct ) was achieved by a combined external trans - basal approach and endonasal endoscopic approach . the dura mater over the frontal base was intact and allowed to lie free in the cavity under the cover of the pericranial flap to shield between the epidural space and the paranasal sinus or the nose . the postoperative course was uneventful , and all preoperative signs and symptoms resolved immediately after surgery . they are usually clinically silent and are caused by the loss of drainage properties of the sinus mucosa . mucoceles that result from trauma are mostly due to compromised ventilation , and can occur between 1 and 35 years later in the literature . in our case this suggests the need for long - term follow - up after injury and conscientious anamnesis in suspicious cases . in our opinion , it is good practice to pay attention to post - trauma or postoperative patients with the possibility of mucocele occurring throughout their life . frontal sinus mucocele is a disease that falls between the fields of otolaryngology and neurosurgery . treatment requires removal of the mucocele sac and the offending obstruction with reestablishment of normal sinus drainage . success rates ranging from 78 to 97% have been reported for external approaches , such as trephination , the lynch and modified lynch procedures , and osteoplastic flap techniques with or without frontal sinus obliteration . expansive growth of the frontal sinus mucocele may result in remodeling or destruction of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus . increased intracranial pressure , due to mass effects of the mucocele , the most frequent symptoms of mucocele formation are frontal headache , proptosis , diplopia , nasal congestion , fluid leakage from the nose and swelling over the forehead . a sinus mucocele presents as a non - enhancing , low - attenuation expansile mass on ct . mri demonstrates mucoceles as well - defined , expansile masses with variable signal intensities on t1 and t2 images . these variations in signal intensities depend primarily on the state of hydration , protein content and viscosity of the content of mucocele . in our patient , preoperative ct showed the destruction of the frontal sinus and remodeling of bone in the frontal sinus , and also revealed that the mucocele was directly attached to the dura mater . operatively , the dura mater was very fragile at the points of contact with the mucocele . the safest way to treat a mucocele of this kind is to resect the sinus mucosa completely . this time we performed a standard external approach combined with cranialization of the frontal sinus ( removal of posterior wall ) , removal of mucosa , and wide nasal drainage from the frontal base to the nasal cavity . we consider cranialization and reconstruction of nasofrontal duct through coronal access to be the most appropriate method when the posterior wall of the frontal sinus is remodeled . in most cases , extradural spaces which are formed after surgery become obliterated by the expansion of the frontal lobe within several weeks . in addition , vascularized local flaps are highly effective in preventing contamination of the anterior cranial fossa . for our patient however , when the mucocele is diagnosed in an early pre - invasive stage , the treatment options include minimally invasive surgery and endoscopic treatment , which have considerably less morbidity .',\n",

she showed a narrow range of interests and preferred to spend her time alone . during neuropsychologic evaluation , the patient appeared wakeful and sufficiently compliant , although easily distracted and intolerant of errors . general cognitive abilities were found to be borderline impaired ( intelligence quotient 77 ) when measured with raven s progressive matrices . there was also evidence of impaired visuomotor coordination and severe deficits in attention and executive function . a computed tomography brain study revealed a few bilateral cortical convolutions and microscopic subcortical calcifications ( figure 1 ) , especially in the frontal regions . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain revealed smooth opercula and frontal ( both superior and middle frontal circumvolutions ) cortex ( figure 2a  d ) and a  cobblestone  an electroencephalogram performed when she was 21 years old showed diffusely deregulated cerebral electrical activity together with ubiquitous fast paroxysms , prevalent in the left temporal area ( figure 4 ) . the patient has been undergoing logopedistic rehabilitation since one year of age ; she also underwent psychomotor rehabilitation from 3 years up to 10 years of age , with an improvement in communicative ability and emotional control . her salivary incontinence was ameliorated by administration of an anticholinergic drug ( trihexyphenidyl 2 mg twice daily ) . the main complications of congenital cmv infection in children are microcephaly , mental retardation , motor disabilities , neurosensorial deafness , ocular symptoms related to chorioretinitis , and epilepsy . congenital cmv infections are clinically silent in the newborn period in 10%15% of patients , and the extent of neurologic damage is highly variable . cmv can infect the developing germinative matrix of the brain and can cause lissencephaly if the infection occurs in the earlier half of the second trimester of pregnancy ; if the infection occurs later , there is polymicrogyria.6 therefore , the timing of the intrauterine infection is important in determining both the type and severity of the resulting developmental abnormality , and infections occurring in an earlier period of gestation can result in more severe malformations of cortical development than those occurring in later periods.7,8 polymicrogyria would be due to infection in the first and second phase of the third trimester of gestation , and fetal ischemia can produce cerebral microgyria.9 it has been suggested that perfusion deficits can be caused by the cmv itself , which is able to infect endothelial cells of the intracranial vessels.10 one group of authors11 has described four cases of microgyria associated with intrauterine cmv infection ; according to the literature , microgyria is a common neuropathologic feature of the disease , resulting not from a neurogenetic or a histogenetic disorder , but from a deficit of cerebral perfusion . the mechanisms of the brain damage caused by cmv infection are still unclear , but might include brain ischemia , vasculitis , or more probably , a transitory lowering or absence of systemic perfusion.11 mri is the gold standard for study of the brain in the event of neurologic complications of intrauterine cmv infection ( neuronal migration abnormalities and cortical dysplasia ) . the main mri findings are dilation of the ventricles and pericerebral spaces , oligo / pachygyria , delayed myelination , and periventricular cysts . intracranial calcifications are common ( accounting for more than 77% of the abnormalities in patients with congenital cmv ) , although non - specific.7 the calcifications may be small and periventricular , sometimes thicker and straight , and are usually located at the corticosubcortical interface as well as near the basal ganglia.12,13 calcifications are best seen on brain computed tomography . the diagnostic problem of congenital cmv infection arises because of late diagnosis , usually after the neonatal period ( that is , after 3 months of life ) . nevertheless , its neurologic complications may become evident only around months 69 of life , when the diagnosis is no longer possible . in our case , the topography of the lesions and their bilateral distribution correlated with symptoms , since perisylvian lesions are typically associated with pseudobulbar palsy .',\n",

       " {'article': 'myxomas are the most common type of cardiac tumors , and approximately 75% of these tumors originate in the left atrium and 15% to 20% in the right atrium , with only less than 10% arising from the right and left ventricles . however , the incidence of myxomas in the great vein is extremely rare , and a thorough review of the literature demonstrates only one case in the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) , one case in the femoral vein , and one case in the superior vena cava ( svc ) . most patients present clinically with one or more of a triad of emboli , intracardiac obstruction , and constitutional manifestation ; furthermore , a small myxoma has no symptoms . a 24-year - old man presented with moderate shortness of breath of two months duration , which was intermittent and unrelated to exercise or rest . physical examination showed normal vital signs , blood pressure of 110/80 mm hg , and pulse rate of 75 beats per minutes and regular . there were no abnormal physical findings such as jugular venous distention , rales , and edema . there was a holosystolic murmur ( grade 2/6 ) over the right parasternal area with radiation to the left . laboratory findings of note were a hematocrit value of 43% and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 12 . chest x - ray revealed no abnormalities , and the electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with normal voltage waves . the patient underwent two - dimensional echocardiography , which demonstrated a 4  5  5 cm atrial mass attached by a long stalk to the svc . during atrial systole , the mass moved into the tricuspid annulus , resulting in an apparent obstruction . based on these findings , a right atrium tumor was diagnosed and the patient underwent surgery . the venous return was accomplished by svc - ivc cannulation , and the aorta was cross - clamped with cardioplegic arrest . core cooling to 32 c , aortic occlusion , and cold cardioplegic arrest provided exposure to the tumor through an extended right atriotomy to the svc . the right atrium was opened , and a cluster of grape - shaped , glistening , white masses of leathery consistency ( as reported by devig ) was noted within it . the mass was not attached to the right atrial wall and had a long stalk , which was emerging from the svc orifice ( figures 1 - 3 ) . cavotomy was performed at the site where the stalk was palpable ; and under tension and stretching of the stalk , the point of origin was determined to be in the proximal part of the svc wall . decision was made to extirpate the stalk base under caudal traction . with the aid of this maneuver , the tumor base was excised from the svc wall and the small defect in the svc was repaired . the patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass uneventfully , and his postoperative course was unremarkable . pathologic examination of the tumor revealed a 57 cm firm , cluster tumor , and histological examination revealed a benign myxoma . myxomas were reported for the first time in 1845 by king and then by goldberg in 1952 . diagnostic methods for myxomas include chest radiography ( pulmonary hypertension , atrial enlargement ) , two - dimensional transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) , transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) , and angiography , as well as some other noninvasive modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging . tee is helpful for the precise localization of a tumor and its point of attachment as well as obstruction of cardiac valves . the indication for selective angiography in patients with myxomas remains for the detection of coronary artery disease if the patients are more than 40 years old . rath and demorise utilized this imaging method for the detection of coronary artery embolus and myocardial infarction in patients with myxomas . cardiac tumors are exceedingly rare , with the incidence ranging between 0.001% and 0.03% of the autopsied specimens . approximately , 75% of primary cardiac tumors are benign , and myxomas are the most frequent type of benign intracardiac tumors with an incidence ranging from 83% to 92% . a literature search revealed only 5 previously reported cases of myxomas arising from the femoral vein , ivc ( two cases ) , eustachian valve , and svc . another instance of a lesion arising from the svc was reported by teixido et al . bontolotti and associates reported a patient with unusual findings of a right atrial myxoma arising from the supra hepatic segment of the ivc ; the tumor was excised under core cooling and cardioplegic arrest with a short period of low - flow cardiopulmonary bypass . along the same lines , devig and colleagues described a young man who underwent an excision of a right atrial myxoma located at the junction of the right atrial wall and the anterosuperior aspect of the ivc . chiming in with the previous findings , cujec and associates reported a 21-year - old man with a right atrial myxoma arising from the eustachian valve that prolapsed to the ivc , causing the budd - chiari syndrome , and elmusa et al . reported the excision of a right atrial myxoma from the supra hepatic segment of the ivc . were the first to report the case of a young man diagnosed with a testicular germ cell tumor with pulmonary metastasis : there was a large vegetative mass arising from the svc and extending through the right atrium . right atrial myxomas may present with embolic obstructive or constitutional signs and symptoms like syncopal attack , exertional dyspnea , and chest discomfort due to a transient occlusion of the tricuspid by a thrombus or a fragment of the tumor tissue . the most characteristic finding is an ejection - type systolic murmur in the pulmonary area that often varies from day to day or with positional change . be that as it may , the absence of symptoms , with the exception of dyspnea , in our patient was remarkable insofar as other patients with right atrial myxomas are reported to complain of vague constitutional symptoms such as malaise , low - grade fever , weakness , and unexplained weight loss . laboratory examinations typically reveal microcytic anemia in addition to an elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate . once the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma is established , a prompt excision is essential to prevent complications . in our patient , the myxoma was attached to the medial wall of the svc and the stalk of the tumor was clearly visualized by the tee . patients with complex and familial myxomas are characterized by younger age , atypical location , multiple tumor sites , and high incidence of recurrent tumors . painstaking surgical management and postoperative follow - up are , therefore , of vital importance in this group of patients . as this case report clearly shows , rare and bizarre variations in the origin of myxomas may occur and they can not be discovered preoperatively unless an index of suspicion is maintained .',\n",

( pod ) 11 , brain ct showed further reduction in bilateral tbgh and ivh and enlargement of ventricle size associated with scalp bulging at the operation site ( figure 3a ) . at pod 39 , ventriculoperitoneal shunting and cranioplasty using autologous bone tbgh is uncommon and bilateral tbgh is extremely rare.36 ) we were unable to find any case of bilateral tbgh in a child in the literature and could not obtain any information about the hospital course and treatment . the child 's brain is resilient and able to compensate for acutely increased icp due to intracerebral hematoma because the skull has expansibility.2 ) anatomical aspects of younger child to head injuries are large head to body ratio , relatively weak neck , thinner skull , and larger subarachnoid space in which the brain can move freely.13 ) for this reason , a child 's brain has the ability to expand and buffer against impact but vulnerable to damages . a small amount of tbgh ( < 2 cm in diameter ) can be considered as a hemorrhagic contusion.4 ) it can be related to diffuse axonal injury when it is associated with contusions and/or small hemorrhage in the corpus callosum , basal ganglia , tegmentum of pons , ivh , and acute brain swelling.11 ) the pathophysiologic mechanism of unilateral tbgh is unclear , but is believed to occur from shear strain in ganglionic lesion.12 ) mosberg and lindenberg4 ) demonstrated a traumatic tear of a pallidal branch of anterior choroidal artery as the origin of pallidal hematoma in an autopsy case . head injuries including traffic accidents associated with acceleration and deceleration forces with rotational movement traumatic dissection of perforating arteries , mainly the anterior choroidal artery or lenticulostriate artery , can cause basal ganglia hemorrhage.61012 ) still , the exact explanation for bilateral tbgh is elusive in the literature . we think this phenomenon could develop by similar mechanism , but do not know whether the hemorrhage developed simultaneously in both sides or separately over time . in this case , initial ct scans showed a difference in hemorrhage volume on both sides of the brain , with the larger diameter of 3.6 cm on the right side and 3.1 cm on the left side . this finding did not provide any clues about the mechanism of bilateral hemorrhage development , especially the time sequence . whether to treat this patient or not depended on his clinical condition . our patient showed poor neurological condition at admission and we decided to remove both hemorrhage areas using stereotactic aspiration and periodic urokinase irrigation . six hours after admission the operation was performed and urokinase irrigation was done every 8 hours . no literature references concerning urokinase irrigation for children are available ; we decided to use 8,000 iu of urokinase , which is the amount that we usually use to treat adult patients . initially , 5 cc of regimen would be tolerable for a child . during the first 24 hours postoperatively , 110 cc was drained from the right side indicating cerebrospinal fluid mixture , with < 5 cc drained from the left side . routine brain ct at pod2 demonstrated markedly decreased hemorrhage at both basal ganglia but diffuse low density lesions around the previous hemorrhage . these findings are not typical in adult basal ganglia hemorrhage and we presumed the cause of this finding the possibility of the urokinase overdosage and toxicity . brain edema caused by thrombin might be greatly amplified by the presence of plasminogen activators , perhaps because the latter compete for naturally occurring thrombin inhibitors.1 ) the authors concluded that in the context of intracerebral hemorrhage the use of tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase ( upa ) to lyse clotted blood in brain parenchyma may promote edema formation in surrounding tissue.7 ) a case featuring protracted perihematomal edema after hematoma evacuation and fibrinolysis therapy with upa was reported.8 ) recent studies indicate that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) capillaries and the newborn bbb has restrictive properties similar to that of the adult . in our case under the condition of bbb disruption due to initial hemorrhage injection of adult dose of urokinase into the hemorrhage site may aggravate cerebral edema around cerebral tissue.579 ) also , the total of 110 cc drainage through the right draining catheter may have masked this edema formation during the first postoperative 24 hours . thus we presumed his neurological condition was poor and that a second operation was needed . bilateral tbgh is very rare in children and there are limited information how to treat child patients . further investigations into the use of urokinase , especially in children , are needed .\",\n",

dimensionally registered to their 3d - spgr mr images using the automated medical images registration ( amir ) program . regions of interest ( rois ) , i.e. 8.5-mm - diameter circles , were defined interactively on the resliced pet images by visual inspection with reference to the corresponding mr image . the rois were placed over the bilateral thalamus , caudate , putamen , and psa , and the cerebral glucose metabolism in each region was measured . the values of cerebral glucose metabolism in the rois were normalized according to the global cerebral glucose metabolism , which was calculated by averaging voxels < 20% of the maximum value . the normalized values of glucose metabolism in each area in the patient were compared to the corresponding average values in the normal controls , and a difference of 2.5 sd from the controls was considered statistically significant . the correlation coefficient between the severity of blepharospasm and the normalized glucose metabolism in each area studied was also calculated . the glucose metabolism in the thalamus of the patient was increased significantly on days 149 and 212 ( table 1 ) . however , a significant change was not observed in the other areas ( caudate , putamen , and psa ) . the severity of the blepharospasm was 3 on day 149 , 2 on day 212 , 1 on day 310 , 1 on day 443 , and 2 on day 688 . regression analyses with the data of the bilateral thalamus demonstrated a significant positive correlation between cerebral glucose metabolism and the severity of the blepharospasm [ correlation coefficient ( r ) : right : 0.853 ( p < 0.05 ) , left : 0.953 ( p < 0.01 ) ] ( fig . we observed cerebral glucose hypermetabolism in the thalamus of a patient with drug - related blepharospasm . reduced cerebral glucose metabolism in the thalamus was found to be correlated with an improvement in the blepharospasm . thus , the activity in the thalamus may be related to the severity of blepharospasms . blepharospasm is a dystonic disorder , and there are several reports on cerebral glucose hypermetabolism in the thalamus of patients with dystonia [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 ] , including our previous report . classified blepharospasms on the basis of severity ( mild , moderate , and severe ) in 10 patients and examined the relationship between the severity and cerebral glucose metabolism in the thalamus using f - fdg pet . they did not find a correlation between glucose metabolism and blepharospasm severity in their study , possibly because the interval between the most recent botulinum toxin injection and pet was not uniform in each patient . further , odergren et al .   measured cerebral blood flow in four patients with writer 's cramp and four controls , using pet . they reported that the perceived difficulty and signs of dystonia progressed with the duration of writing , which in turn correlated with increased activity in the thalamus of the patients . many studies have reported thalamic hyperactivity in patients with dystonic diseases , but the neurophysiological mechanisms of this hyperactivity are not well defined . in our previous study , we observed glucose hypermetabolism in the thalamus of eb patients whose spasms were suppressed by botulinum toxin treatment . this result may indicate that the hyperactivity in the thalamus is caused by the blepharospasm itself . on the other hand first , the somatosensory input from the skin induced by dystonic movement may activate the basal ganglia - thalamocortical motor circuit . investigated the interference of tactile and painful stimuli on thalamocortical processing of somatosensory information in humans , using somatosensory evoked potentials . second , the activation of the thalamus may be due to neuronal projection from the muscle spindle that contracts with dystonic muscle spasms . observed that the neurons that project from the jaw - muscle spindle to the thalamus were activated with microelectrodes in the rat . in the present study examined 254 patients with blepharospasm and reported that 13.8% of them had used etizolam before the onset of blepharospasm . the clinical features of drug - related blepharospasm are similar to those of eb , and the spasms may resolve on discontinuing the use of related drugs . in our case , the symptoms of blepharospasm improved to some extent after etizolam was discontinued and , thus , the patient 's condition could be diagnosed as drug - related blepharospasm .\",\n",

after lengthy discussion , the patient agreed to go forward with the procedure . on laparotomy in addition to extensive carcinomatosis , the patient was found to have a right sided malignant - appearing retroperitoneal process involving the appendix , cecum and right colon as well as a separate different appearing left - sided process involving the left ovary and sigmoid colon . cytoreductive surgery included en bloc resection of right retroperitoneal mass involving the appendix and cecum , total colectomy , proximal protectomy , left oophorectomy en bloc with partial small bowel and partial bladder resection , total peritonectomy and cholecystectomy . the patient then underwent hipec for 90 minutes with mitomycin c at 10 mg / m . following hipec , an ileorectal anastomosis with loop ileostomy was performed and a central venous catheter with access port was placed in anticipation of future chemotherapeutic treatment . the patient was extubated and transferred to the icu for further care with normal postoperative recovery with discharge on postoperative day 12 . subsequent surgical pathology results confirmed two separate malignant processes causing the carcinomatosis : \\n perforated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix arising from villous adenoma , at least 8.5 cm invading into subserosa and into adjacent ileal and cecal serosa with widespread involvement of omentum ( carcinomatosis).left perforated ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma with widespread involvement of fallopian tube and subserosa of sigmoid colon ( carcinomatosis).immunohistochemical examination was performed on the surgical specimens . the appendiceal tumor stained negative for ck-7 and positive for ck-20 ( fig .  1 ) , whereas the ovarian sample stained positive for ck-7 and negative for ck-20 ( fig .  2 ) , consistent with malignant processes of independent origins . \\n figure  1:appendix . . perforated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix arising from villous adenoma , at least 8.5 cm invading into subserosa and into adjacent ileal and cecal serosa with widespread involvement of omentum ( carcinomatosis ) . left perforated ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma with widespread involvement of fallopian tube and subserosa of sigmoid colon ( carcinomatosis ) . in the available literature , synchronous tumors of the ovary and appendix are an uncommon yet well - recognized occurrence in the setting of pp . the origin of such synchronous tumors is widely debated with most evidence favoring a primary appendiceal tumor with the ovarian tumor representing a metastatic process [ 1 , 2 ] . to address the questions of tumor origin in pp , ronnett et al .   studied a series of 68 women with pp , 30 of which had ovarian involvement , and found that none of these cases were unequivocally ovarian in origin . as is the case with this example , existing literature on coexisting appendiceal and ovarian tumors resulting peritoneal dissemination by malignant processes is limited to those presenting with the less grave process of pp . in the absence of pp , there have been only two cases , to our knowledge , of synchronous tumors or the ovary and appendix with each representing a primary process as reported by rudzki et al .   and bozanovic et al . , the appendix appeared grossly normal and appendectomy was performed as routine in the setting of total abdominal hysterectomy with oophorectomy for large right - sided ovarian tumor . investigation with immunohistochemical staining revealed a ck7 + and ck20 phenotype of the ovarian tumor and the opposite ( ck7 and ck20 + ) in the appendiceal tumor . present a patient found to have a mass of the cecum with adhesion to the right ovary on exploratory laparotomy for acute abdomen ;

       " {'article': \"adolescents constitute only a small percentage of treatment seekers in drug dependence treatment settings ( 15 years : 0.4% and 16 - 20 years : 4.6% ) . community surveys suggest that tobacco , alcohol and cannabis are prevalent substances of abuse among indian adolescents , but opioid use is quite uncommon in this age group ( about 1 in 1000 ) . heroin use was seen in 3.3% of drug - using adolescents in contact with nehru yuva kendras ( grass - root level voluntary organization for youth ) across the country . potentially serious complications , e.g. sexual risks , violence and other high risk behaviors are associated with adolescent substance use , which may pose a significant public health issue . the long - term pharmacotherapies for opioid dependence can be either in the form of an opioid agonist ( e.g. buprenorphine ) or antagonist ( e.g. naltrexone ) therapy . the use of pharmacotherapies , in conjunction with psychosocial support , is the mainstay of treatment of adult opioid users , but there is only a limited evidence base for their efficacy in adolescents with opioid dependence . very few reports or studies are available till date on long - term buprenorphine maintenance for adolescent opioid users and only one study has described the use of naltrexone ( antagonist ) in adolescent opioid dependence . buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu - opioid receptor , which is used in low to moderate doses to enable the patient to abstain from the use of illicit opioids and prevent craving or withdrawals . it is available as sublingual ( 2 mg/4 mg ) tablets administered under supervision of staff usually on a daily basis in view of their abuse liability . a take - home combination of sublingual buprenorphine - naloxone ( 4:1 ) is available which is ineffective by intravenous route , thereby minimizing the risk of abuse . naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which blocks the effects of opioids and prevents the positive reinforcement associated with the use of opioids . no prior study or case report from india has described the use of agonist maintenance or antagonist therapy for adolescent opioid users . we discuss two adolescent patients with opioid ( heroin ) dependence visiting national drug dependence treatment centre ( nddtc ) , all india institute of medical sciences ( aiims ) , new delhi for treatment , who were stablilized on buprenorphine and naltrexone respectively for a substantial period of time . master a , 15 years old , studied up to 6 std and belonged to a middle socio - economic status joint family living in a small town in the state of uttar pradesh ( 300 km from centre ) . he presented to adolescent clinic , nddtc , aiims with parents for the first time in january 2009 with chief complaints of the regular use of tobacco ( both smokeless and smoking ) for 8 years , occasional cannabis ( ganja ) use for 3 years and regular heroin ( smack ) use for 3 years . heroin , the primary drug of use , was initiated at the age of 12 years out of curiosity with some of his friends and later , continued for its pleasurable effects . there was evidence of tolerance , withdrawals and diminished control over the time and amount of heroin use . the usual daily dose was 2 - 3 pudias ( worth rs 100 - 150 ) . as a result of drug use , he started having frequent discord with parents and siblings . he engaged in stealing and working as an accomplice of pick - pocketers to sustain drug use . he spent many nights out of his house without informing his whereabouts and experienced a significant decline in physical health and social functioning . the heroin use continued uninterrupted for 3 years till he presented for treatment on parent 's initiative . the personal history suggested the presence of conduct symptoms ( truancy , lying , stealing from home ) since childhood prior to onset of drug use . the complete hemogram , blood sugar , liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits . patient was hospitalized for management of withdrawals with gradually tapering the dose of low strength buprenorphine ( 0.4 mg s / l tab ; 2 mg / day ) and subsequently , initiated on naltrexone ( 25 mg / day ; dispensed from centre 's pharmacy free of cost ) . psychosocial interventions aimed at rapport - building , motivation enhancement and psycho education were offered . however , patient was lost to follow - up after discharge restarting the heroin use and spending time with drug - using peers . there were two more admissions in ensuing months ( june 2009 and august 2009 ; about 2 weeks each ) which were considered for the purpose of detoxification and reinstatement of naltrexone in view of long distance of travel . the psychosocial intervention sessions were provided for patient ( to identify high risk situations , relapse prevention , coping skills enhancement , vocational skill building ) . efforts were also made to engage the family members more actively in treatment process ( and address mother 's overprotective behavior for patient and conflict between parents ) . however , after each of these admissions , there was no follow - up visit in opd and patient resumed the drug use . however , after the 4th admission ( 2 weeks ; october 2009 ) and subsequent discharge on naltrexone ( 25 mg / day ) , he followed up in out - patient clinic with parents as advised during the ward sessions . patient continued with the fortnightly follow - up , compliant to medication and maintaining abstinence ( as confirmed by parents and repeated urinalysis ) for a period of 10 months ( oct 2009-aug 2010 ) . throughout this duration , parents were actively involved in treatment process , supervising the compliance at home and participating in sessions . patient would intermittently report disinclination to take naltrexone , due to occasional body aches , discomfort and  not feeling fit(protracted withdrawals ) . eventually , he refused to take naltrexone on his own , relapsed within a few days and was lost to follow up for nearly an year . he again presented to the out - patient clinic ( in july 2011 ) with the current use of 3 - 4 pudias ( small packets ) smack on a daily basis . he was not doing any meaningful activity , mostly staying away of home even during nights and engaged in anti - social activities with drug - using peers . plan for long term management was discussed with patient as well as both parents , during which patient reported disinclination to take naltrexone due to physical discomfort . after a re - assessment , patient was initiated and stabilized on agonist replacement regimen ( buprenorphine - naloxone combination 4 mg / day ) , which was dispensed biweekly to either of parents . patient felt comfortable on above medication and completely abstained from street heroin ( confirmed by negative results on urinalysis using thin layer chromatography or rapid cassette tests ) , though occasional cannabis use continued . he would not go out with drug - using peers and started remaining at home , leading to improvement in his relationships with family . his father involved him in their small - scale manufacturing unit ( packeted eatables / snacks ) and patient fulfilled various responsibilities , including financial handlings with no complaints . patient works for nearly 7 - 8 h in a day and spends time with family in evenings . currently , patient is on the same dose of buprenorphine - naloxone ( 4 mg / day ) for nearly 2 years ( dispensed fortnightly to him / his parents ) , during which he visits the center every month for follow - up continuing till date . master b , 17 years old , school drop - out after primary class , belonged to nuclear family of lower middle socioeconomic status residing in delhi . patient had a history of regular tobacco and occasional cannabis ( ganja ) use since 10 years of age , regular inhalant use ( correction fluid- 1bottle / day ) since 11 years of age and heroin use since 16 years of age . at the time of presentation , heroin was the primary drug of use for nearly a year , with a usual dose of 1 - 2 pudias ( small packets ; worth rs 50 - 100 ) per day . there was significant dysfunction in all the major domains of functioning and patient never tried to abstain ( except for 2 - 3 forced admissions in unauthorized privately run centers lasting few weeks ) . in the psychiatric history , at the age of 17 years , patient had a moderate depressive episode lasting 2 weeks and in the ensuing 6 months , there were further four depressive episodes ( each lasting 10 - 20 days ) and two hypo - manic episodes ( 3 - 5 days each ) , all of which had no apparent precipitating factor and remitted spontaneously . patient was using tobacco and heroin during this period , but no temporal relationship was observed with drug use . there was a childhood history suggestive of hyperactivity / impulsivity and inattentiveness since 5 - 6 years of age leading to poor academic performance and subsequent drop - out from school . no treatment was sought and symptoms improved after early adolescence . in addition , there is also a history of conduct symptoms prior to onset of drug use ( truancy , lying to parents , initiating quarrels , physical fights , throwing stones and kicking small animals , running away from home ) . patient fulfilled the icd-10 diagnostic criteria for tobacco dependence , opioid dependence and bipolar affective disorder - not otherwise specified , and a lifetime diagnosis of volatile solvent dependence and hyperkinetic conduct disorder . psychosocial treatment sessions focused on enhancing motivation and providing psycho education on various aspects of substance use and psychiatric disorders . after a detailed assessment , by the third out - patient visit , the patient was started on tab naltrexone ( 50 mg / day ) and tab valproate ( 1 gm / day ) . patient continued in regular follow up on the above medication for a period of 1 year and 4 months . the compliance was supervised by mother and he began assisting his father in tailoring in the initial few months . there were no further mood episodes during this period and patient was largely abstinent from illicit substances , confirmed by repeated cassette tests . the occasional use of cannabis , however , persisted along with a few behavioral problems . the psychosocial intervention sessions were delivered at each follow - up and some of the patient 's conflicts with parents were taken up during the sessions . master a , 15 years old , studied up to 6 std and belonged to a middle socio - economic status joint family living in a small town in the state of uttar pradesh ( 300 km from centre ) . he presented to adolescent clinic , nddtc , aiims with parents for the first time in january 2009 with chief complaints of the regular use of tobacco ( both smokeless and smoking ) for 8 years , occasional cannabis ( ganja ) use for 3 years and regular heroin ( smack ) use for 3 years . heroin , the primary drug of use , was initiated at the age of 12 years out of curiosity with some of his friends and later , continued for its pleasurable effects . there was evidence of tolerance , withdrawals and diminished control over the time and amount of heroin use . the usual daily dose was 2 - 3 pudias ( worth rs 100 - 150 ) . as a result of drug use , he started having frequent discord with parents and siblings . he engaged in stealing and working as an accomplice of pick - pocketers to sustain drug use . he spent many nights out of his house without informing his whereabouts and experienced a significant decline in physical health and social functioning . the heroin use continued uninterrupted for 3 years till he presented for treatment on parent 's initiative . the personal history suggested the presence of conduct symptoms ( truancy , lying , stealing from home ) since childhood prior to onset of drug use . the complete hemogram , blood sugar , liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits . patient was hospitalized for management of withdrawals with gradually tapering the dose of low strength buprenorphine ( 0.4 mg s / l tab ;

patient b : 1.3 years ) , were abstinent from heroin and engaged in meaningful work . the use of buprenorphine maintenance is quite uncommon among adolescent patients and very few studies have evaluated its efficacy in this age group , which is summarized here . a multi - site study of opioid - dependent youth ( of which 12 were adolescents ) examined buprenorphine - naloxone treatment vs. standard detoxification , and found significantly better outcomes in drug use and other measures at the end of 12 weeks . however , the adolescent sub - sample in this study was deemed to be inadequate for a separate analysis . a file review from an australian treatment setting compared first treatment episode of adolescents on buprenorphine ( n = 25 ) versus methadone ( n = 20 ) , and found that treatment retention was higher in methadone compared to buprenorphine ( mean : 354 days vs. 58 days ) in adolescents . another us study reported positive experiences of few adolescent patients on buprenorphine in a substance abuse treatment program that also focused on adolescent development . finally , a cochrane review of various databases ( 1966 - 2008 ) for randomized or controlled trials for effectiveness of any maintenance agent in adolescents , found only two trials ( only one of which involved buprenorphine ) . the cochrane review was inconclusive and meta - analysis could not be carried out with two heterogeneous trials . there is often a general policy of dispensing agonist medication only to adult patients due to concerns about starting youth on treatment that is often long - term and reluctance to bring young patients into daily contact with adult patients with extensive addiction histories and antisocial behaviors . however , a small percentage of adolescents with early - onset of opioid dependence may experience severe dysfunction , engage in high risk and anti - social behaviors and show a poor motivation to quit . it has been recommended elsewhere too that agonist maintenance may be considered for adolescents who have opioid dependence , age is at least 16 years or above , opioid use 1 year and two documented failed attempts . so far , only one study is available for naltrexone use in adolescent opioid dependence . in this preliminary non - controlled , extended - release naltrexone was found to be safe and efficacious in a sample of 16 adolescents and young adults ( mean age : 18.5 years ) . of total , 10 were retained in treatment for at least 4 months and 9 had a good outcome . in addition , few studies and case reports have evaluated the overall safety of naltrexone for adolescents with alcohol use disorders ( sample age : 16 - 18 years ; dose 50 mg / day ) . the patients discussed above , naltrexone was initiated after a discussion with patient , parents and a review of existing literature . naltrexone was tolerated well at the dose of 50 mg / day , with no significant adverse effects . compared to patient a , patient b had a shorter duration of heroin use and consequently , did not experience any protracted withdrawals , craving or need for an agonist . it is to be noted that adolescent opioid users frequently have a number of other problems , e.g. the use of drugs by peers , poor family support , living in a locality with easy availability of drugs and underlying psychiatric morbidity , some of which were present in one or both patients . failure to address those issues will reduce the chance of successful treatment and increase the risk of relapse . the comorbid bipolar disorder was managed with a mood stabilizer in patient b , with no recurrence during follow - up period . a good family support was present in both cases , which played a crucial role in ensuring compliance to medication and other treatment aspects . for example , the take - home doses of buprenorphine - naloxone were dispensed free of cost as a policy , but family members had to travel several hours by train to reach center on a fortnightly basis , thereby investing time and other resources over these years . in indian context , the active involvement of family in various aspects of treatment process contributes immensely toward improved functioning of the patient . some drug using adolescents may not have a family or family support , but wherever available , their participation should be actively sought at all treatment steps . to conclude , the case report adds to the limited literature on efficacy of pharmacotherapies for adolescent opioid use . however , there is a need to conduct systematically planned studies on the adolescent opioid use treatment .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative granulomatous infection caused by anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria , primarily from the genus actinomyces . any site of body can be affected by actinomycosis , but hepatic involvement is rare . hepatic actinomycosis is usually secondary to other intraabdominal infections , and primary hepatic actinomycosis only accounts for 5% of all actinomycosis cases.1 a diagnosis of hepatic actinomycosis is frequently missed because of its indolent and slowly progressive characters , and non - specific clinical and radiologic manifestations . we experienced a case of 57-year - old man with multiple asymptomatic space occupying lesions of liver , which were ultimately found to be primary hepatic actinomycosis . a 57-year - old man was referred to the department of internal medicine for multiple hepatic masses . however , multiple hepatic masses were detected on follow - up computed tomography ( ct ) at 1 year after operation . they were ill - defined and showed heterogeneous low - attenuation on delayed phase ( fig . he did not complain of any symptom including fever , chilling , abdominal pain or weight loss . he had eaten sliced beef omasum ( the 3 compartment of the stomach in ruminants ) 1 month ago . on physical examination , his blood pressure was 121/78 mmhg , pulse rate 80/min , body temperature 36.3. he did not appear acutely ill , and presented no abdominal tenderness , palpable organ , or enlarged lymph node . white blood cell ( wbc ) count was 8,500/mm ( neutrophil 65.5% , lymphocyte 28.0% , eosinophil 1.5% ) . his serum alkaline phosphatase and c - reactive protein were elevated to 153 iu / l ( 40 - 120 iu / l ) and 6.1 mg / dl , respectively . serologic markers of hepatitis b and c were all negative , while the antibody to toxocara was positive . considering history of eating omasum and positivity for toxocara antibody , liver biopsy was done and albendazole was prescribed on clinical impression of hepatic toxocariasis . percutaneous liver biopsy revealed polymorphous inflammatory cells with fibrosis and marked plasma cell infiltration which is consistent with organizing abscess . abdominal ct showed the pre - existing multiple hepatic masses increasing in size and extending to the parietal peritoneum . they were heterogeneously low - attenuated with peripheral hyperemic changes on arterial phase , and highly attenuated on delayed phase . serum immunoglobulin g ( igg ) was elevated to 2580 mg / dl ( 700 - 1,600 mg / dl ) , while immunoglobulin g4 ( igg4 ) was within normal range . a whole body positron emission tomography - ct showed multiple hypermetabolic hepatic masses ( maximum standardized uptake value ( suv ) of 14.3 ) and generalized hypermetabolic lymph nodes ( maximum suv of 5.0 ) . the second percutaneous liver biopsy was done and showed the organizing abscesses , which was the same for the previous one ( fig . the number of igg4 positive plasma cell was 14/high power field ( hpf ) and igg / igg4 was rated less than 5% . no organisms were identified by gram stain and culture , acid - fast bacilli stain and culture , and fungus culture of the liver tissue . although igg4 level was not elevated , systemic corticosteroid was administered on the possible diagnosis of the hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor . multiple hepatic masses became more prominent and invaded into the muscle layer of right abdominal wall on ct ( fig . 3 ) . to find out an unusual infection which might be aggravated during immunosuppressive treatment , the exploratory laparotomy was performed . on the operative the surgically biopsied tissue for the lesion showed chronic inflammation with abscess and sulfur granule on hematoxylin and eosin stain . 4 ) . the tissue culture did not identify any organisms incubated aerobically and anaerobically up to 2 weeks . the acid - fast bacilli stain was negative and there was no evidence of malignancy . intravenous penicillin g for a week and ceftriaxone for 5 weeks was administered and then changed to oral amoxicillin for 11 weeks . after 2 months of treatment , the size of hepatic masses was decreased on the abdominal ct and the clinical symptoms were improved . the diagnosis was rather easily made by percutaneous liver biopsy and further surgical procedures were not needed in most of the cases . in korea , all of the reported cases were confirmed as primary hepatic actinomycosis after one percutaneous biopsy.2,3,4,5,6 however , in our case , the patient was ultimately diagnosed after surgery following two uninformative percutaneous biopsies . the possible explanations for delayed diagnosis are the insufficient incubation period and the lack of the appropriate anaerobic media . because neither white blood cells nor bacteria were seen on initial gram stain which was done in the microbiology laboratory , the biopsy specimen was incubated only 2 days for culture . in addition , the surfur granules , which virtually guarantee the diagnosis of actinomycosis,6 were relatively scarce on our specimen so would have been hardly detected . furthermore , as our patient was asymptomatic and the space occupying lesions of the liver were found on routine check - up after cancer surgery , to suspect infectious diseases were far more difficult . actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by anaerobic or microaerophillic bacteria from the genus actinomyces . this infection has a tendency to form draining sinuses , which discharge a conglomeration of actinomyces filaments solidified with elements of tissue exudate , so called surfur granules . the most important step in the pathogenesis of this organism is a disruption of mucosal integrity.7 for example , poor oral hygiene , long - standing intrauterine device , peptic ulcer , gastrointestinal infection , and recent abdominal surgery are recognized as predisposing factors.8 it also applies to our patient because he underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy 12 months prior to the detection of hepatic actinomycosis . the proportion of actinomycosis which involves abdomen is about 20% of reported cases.9 of them , hepatic infection is present in 15% of the patients , which comprises 5% of all actinomycosis cases.1 clinical manifestations are generally non - specific and indolent , with fever , weight loss or abdominal pain . laboratory data have frequently associated leukoaytosis ( 75% ) with a left shift , anemia , elevated alkaline phosphatase levels ( 83.3% ) with actinomycosis.10 elevated alkaline phosphatase levels ( 83.3% ) with actinomycosis.10 imaging findings are non - specific and often mimic other diseases such as neoplasm ( either primary or metastatic ) . kanellopoulou et al reported in their review of 57 cases of hepatic actinomycosis that the disease manifested as a single abscess / mass in two - thirds of the cases , and as multiple hepatic lesions in the remaining onethird.11 microbiologic and pathologic studies are essential for a diagnosis of actinomycosis . however , such bacterial confirmation is accomplished in less than 50% of cases because of the overgrowth of associated bacteria , lack of the proper media , insufficient incubation period , improper specimen gathering and transportation techniques or prior antibiotic therapy.6,12 lacking absolute bacterial identification , the most helpful diagnostic finding is the detection of sulfur granules . however , when only small quantities of tissues are available , sulfur granules can be easily missed and only inflammation or fibrosis may be identified . for the reasons stated above , the diagnosis of actinomycosis is frequently delayed . in the past , when actinomycosis was much more common , it was referred to as \" the most misdiagnosed disease \" and it still remains a diagnostic challenge despite technological advances.13 therefore , it would be prudent to be suspicious that this rare infection may be present under conditions where cell culture reveals only \" inflammation \" , \" abscess \" or \" fibrosis \" . furthermore , obtaining sufficient amounts of specimen through repeated cultures and even surgical biopsy should be considered to increase the yield of microbiologic and pathologic diagnosis , as evidenced by our case . recently , 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequence analysis has been used as a powerful tool for identifying actinomyces . this method allows for more rapid and accurate identification of actinomycosis possible12 and thus may be useful when actinomycotic chronic inflammation is clinically suspected but no microorganisms are identified in conventional cultures . despite the delay in diagnosis , prognosis is favorable because many antibiotics are available to which actinomyces strains are susceptible . the mortality rate associated with actinomycosis has been reported as 7.6%.1,10,12,14 however , because of the tendency to recur , the antibiotic treatment must incorporate high doses and prolonged duration . a long - term follow - up is also needed for monitoring of the treatment response and for early detection of any recurrence . the duration of treatment should be individualized by disease location , severity , and changes in follow - up imaging results . in general , 10 - 20 million units of intravenous penicillin for 2 to 6 weeks , followed by oral therapy with penicillin or amoxicillin for 6 to 12 months , combined medical and surgical approaches have shown a similar mortality rate with antibiotics monotherapy.10,14 however , surgery alone appears to be inappropriate for the treatment of this disease . 11 hence , treatments for actinomycosis should be based on antibiotics , and in case of refractory diseases , surgery can be considered as an adjunctive therapy . in conclusion , making a diagnosis of primary hepatic actinomycosis is difficult because it is rare and progresses slowly . actinomycosis also mimics a variety of other disorders in terms of clinical manifestations and radiologic findings . hence , when space - occupying lesions of the liver are identified , efforts should be made to enable a microbiologic and pathologic diagnosis as early as possible to detect unusual microorganisms and to exclude malignancy .',\n",

       " {'article': \"the positional interchange of two adjacent teeth is referred to as tooth transposition.123 a number of theories have been proposed to explain this anatomical condition . some authors believe it is of genetic origin4567 while others consider that supernumerary teeth or retained deciduous teeth may cause dental transpositions.8 the most common transposition occurs between the maxillary cuspid and first premolar.910 unilateral transpositions are more common than bilateral , and the left side is more frequently involved than the right.12391011 in complete tooth transpositions , all teeth are involved . in incomplete tooth transpositions , only the crowns are involved , while the roots remain in the correct positions.11213 in cases of tooth transposition , orthodontic therapy may be performed with or without tooth extraction . when teeth are not to be extracted , the orthodontist should consider the relative advantages of aligning teeth in a corrected position or in their transposed position . factors to be considered when choosing the treatment include root and crown position ( which are related to the risk of root resorption ) , gingival quality and gingival level of the transposed teeth , risk of caries , duration of orthodontic treatment,13 dental morphology and the need for dental reshaping , occlusal considerations related to the canines , and facial aesthetics.11 this case report describes the successful treatment of a patient with the maxillary canine and first premolar ( mxc.p1 ) that was corrected with orthodontic therapy . a 12-year - old patient was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unaesthetic dental appearance . the intraoral examination showed that all permanent teeth were erupted , while the deciduous maxillary right canine was retained . her overbite was reduced ( 0 mm ) , with an edge - to - edge relationship between the upper and lower incisors . the upper dental midline was centered with the facial midline ; the lower dental midline was deviated 1 mm to the right ( figures 1 and 2 ) . cone - beam computed tomography ( cbct ) examination revealed a complete transposition of the maxillary left canine and first premolar , close contact between the roots of the left canine and first premolar , and resorption of the distal root surface of the left first premolar ( figures 3 and 4 ) . the upper incisors were proclined and the lower incisors were retroclined ( table 1 ) . soft tissue cephalometric analy showed a dolichofacial pattern with a harmonic profile at rest ; the nasolabial angle was within the reference range and the labiomental angle appeared slightly increased . during spontaneous smiling , the patient 's facial profile appeared to be remarkably concave because of the downward displacement of the tip of the nose . the patient 's periodontal tissues were thin in the frontal mandibular area , and her level of oral hygiene was good ( figure 1 ) . the treatment objectives were to obtain a class i molar and canine relationship with ideal upper and lower incisor inclination , to correct the lower midline with an ideal overjet and overbite , and to correct the mxc.p1 transposition on the left side without extractions and without increasing resorption of the root of the first premolar . the following treatment alternatives were considered for the transposed teeth : 1 ) extraction of all first premolars ; 2 ) extraction of the maxillary left canine or first premolar ; and 3 ) extraction of no teeth , with teeth aligned either in the transposed position or in a corrected position . the extraction options were eliminated because of the patient 's class iii profile and the thin periodontal tissue in her anterior lower arch . taking into account the skeletal class iii pattern with the slight maxillary retrusion and compensated proclination of the upper incisors , three options were considered : a ) an orthognathic surgical operation to correct the skeletal class iii malocclusion ; b ) orthopedic treatment with rapid palatal expansion and reverse headgear to correct the maxillary retrognathia , followed by orthodontic treatment to correct the dental malocclusion ; and c ) orthodontic treatment with dental compensation using intermaxillary elastics . with all of these options , the transposition of the left canine and first premolar could be treated either by aligning the teeth in the transposed order or by correcting the transposition . in an orthognathic operation , we would have positioned the upper incisors in the correct inclination relative to the maxillary occlusal plane , and in the same manner we would have replaced the upper canines in the correct position by correcting the left transposition . an orthognathic operation would have been performed at a later time , closer to the end of skeletal growth . because she was only 12 years old , rapid palatal expansion and reverse headgear could not be considered . therefore , we decided to treat her only with orthodontic compensation of the skeletal class iii malocclusion . because the mxc.p1 transposition was complete , maintaining the transposed order during alignment would have required less time and less risk of worsening the premolar root resorption than would correction of the transposition . however , maintaining the transposition might have required extensive restorative camouflaging of the left canine and first premolar . the patient preferred to have her teeth restored to their correct positions ; therefore , we decided to correct the transposition to achieve a class i canine and molar relationship . straightwire passive self - ligating brackets ( damon 3mx ; ormco corporation , orange , ca , usa ) were placed on both arches . because of the incisors ' inclination and the plan to use class iii intermaxillary elastics to correct the molar and canine relationship , a low torque prescription was used on the upper frontal teeth ( + 7 torque value ) and standard torque was used on the lower incisors ( -1 torque value ) . in order to correct the transposition , an upper central incisor bracket with a higher torque prescription the bracket slot was positioned at the same level as the second premolar bracket slot in order to prevent crown tipping . the root of the first premolar could thus be moved palatally without crown tipping ( figure 5 ) . because the crown of the first premolar was in the correct position , we applied a passive laceback between 26 and 24 . in this way , prevention of mesial tipping of the first premolar was achieved during the alignment phase . after nine months of treatment , the first premolar had a good positive crown torque . this condition was quite evident because the palatal cuspid of the premolar was extruded as compared with the buccal cuspid of the same tooth ( figure 6 ) . a full - thickness buccal flap was performed and a metal button was bonded to the left impacted canine ( figure 7a ) . the crown of the canine was at the same level as the first premolar crown . to facilitate the extrusion of the canine , a ligature wire was connected between the button and the copper - nickel - titanium 0.014 archwire . during extrusion , mesial movement of the impacted canine was accomplished with a ligature wire placed mesially and a coil spring placed between the lateral and first premolars on the left side . a continuous ligature wire was used on the upper frontal teeth in order to reduce flaring . after three months , the canine completely moved over the premolar and the crown appeared under the mucosa . the crown was exposed with a diode laser , and a positive torque bracket ( + 7 torque value ) was bonded to the tooth . after 25 months of active orthodontic treatment , the patient had a bilateral class i molar and canine relationship with good overbite and overjet values . the profile was improved , the lips were competent , and the cephalometric evaluation showed acceptable maxillary and mandibular incisor inclinations . the superimpositions ( alignment tracings of the sella - nasion line at the sella ) showed mesial movement of the upper molars , a reduction of the upper incisor angle , and a slightly increased proclination of the lower incisors ( figure 8) . gingival levels and periodontal tissue architecture were adequate , oral hygiene was good , the smile appeared natural , and the smile line was correct . a lower splint retainer from cuspid to cuspid and a boston retainer with vestibular resin in the upper anterior zone were applied for the retention period . incisal and canine guidances were present ( figures 8 , 9 , 10 , table 1 ) . after two years , intraoral photographs were taken , and the records showed that stable results were achieved with the correction of the mxc.p1 transposition using nonextraction therapy in this patient with class iii malocclusion ( figure 11 ) . management and treatment of a maxillary caninepremolar transposition can be challenging for an orthodontist . the clinician must first decide whether to correct the transposition or maintain the teeth in their transposed positions.1415 both approaches have advantages and disadvantages . correcting the transposition may result in a natural and aesthetic arch form , a pleasant smile , and good architecture of the gingival margins . disadvantages of correcting the transposition include long treatment time , the potential risk of root resorption of involved teeth , difficult torque control for the cuspid and first premolar , and a high risk of dehiscence and fenestration of supporting bone . aligning the teeth the palatal cusp of the premolar may constrain lateral jaw movements and cause intercuspidation problems ; crown reshaping at the conclusion of the treatment must therefore be considered . this treatment option may also cause an unaesthetic gingival contour on the transposed area of the maxilla . advantages of maintaining the transposition include a shorter treatment duration , easier mechanics for the orthodontist , and less risk of root resorption . before making a decision , the clinician should examine the patient clinically and/or radiographically for evidence of fenestration , dehiscence , or root resorption . the current gold standard for the radiographic diagnosis of both impacted and transposed teeth is cbct.161718 with this diagnostic tool , the patient is exposed to low doses of radiation , and detailed information about craniofacial structures can be obtained.18 the cbct of our patient revealed a complete mxc . p1 transposition on the left side of the maxilla , with a partial root resorption on the distal side of the first premolar . the crown of the premolar was in the correct position , but the root was inclined mesially and the cuspid crown was adjacent to the root apex of first premolar . together with the patient , we decided to move the displaced tooth to its correct position . tooth movements were monitored carefully to minimize the risk of worsening the premolar root resorption . the key biomechanical goals were as follows : 1 ) to maintain the mesial root inclination of the premolar , which we accomplished by keeping the bracket slot parallel and at the same level as brackets on adjacent teeth ; 2 ) to move the premolar root palatally in order to achieve a safe distance between cuspid crown and premolar root , which we did by using a high - torque incisor bracket on the first premolar ; 3 ) to move the cuspid forward to its correct mesial position ; and 4 ) to provide ideal second- and third - order bends and values for the cuspid and first premolar in order to guarantee good intercuspidation and pleasant aesthetic results . at the conclusion of the orthodontic treatment , a healthy periodontium was maintained ; premolar root resorption had not progressed ( figure 12 ) ; the patient 's profile was maintained ; and intercuspidation was adequate , with molar and cuspid class i relationships on both sides . the final cbct results showed that displaced tooth roots were located in maxillary medullar bone without fenestrations or dehiscences ( figure 13 ) . our patient understands that the class iii skeletal pattern must be monitored until her growth is complete . they must also understand their patients ' anatomical limitations , ability to comply with treatment requirements , and aesthetic expectations .\",\n",

threatening . the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis can be challenging because the disease can present with a lot of symptoms and diverse radiologic findings ( 1 - 5 ) . among them , spinal sarcoidosis is a very rare entity , occurring in < 1% , and can be manifested as intramedullary , intradural extramedullary , intraspinal epidural spaces and in vertebral bodies ( 6 ) . in korea , only a few cases of neurosarcoidosis involving brain , spinal nerve root , peripheral nerve and spinal dura , have been reported with or without histological confirmation in the literature . patients with spinal sarcoidosis are considered to be at high risk for severe neurological sequelae ( 7 ) . the information available about spinal sarcoidosis management and diagnosis comes from a few case reports , small series and expert opinions ( 8 - 10 ) . however , the documents gave conflicting conclusions regarding the treatment , including corticosteroids and alternative immunosuppressants ( 6 , 7 ) . we recently experienced a patient with isolated spinal cord sarcoidosis , which was confirmed by tissue biopsy and well responsive to high - dose corticosteroid and immunosuppressant . a 54-yr - old woman , with no significant past medical history , presented with progressive 4-extremities weakness and sensory changes , followed by urinary difficulty since 1 month ago and was admitted to our hospital in october 2007 . physical examination revealed increased deep tendon reflex , positive babinski sign and decreased motor power with medical research council ( mrc ) grade 2 strength in the right side and mrc grade 4 strength in the left side . initial magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed increased t2 signal from c4 to c6 level , edematous expansion of the cord and intense nodular enhancement ( fig . 1a ) . based on the mri , spinal cord tumor , demyelinating disease involving multiple sclerosis , serological studies for systemic autoimmunity , including rheumatoid factor and antinuclear , anti - dsdna , anti - ssa / ssb , and antiphospholipid antibodies , showed no abnormality . the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) analysis including biochemistry , igg index and oligoclonal band was normal . one month later , the follow - up spinal mri showed the more extended lesion relative to previous mri , and which highly suggested the spinal cord tumor such as intramedullary astrocytoma ( fig . based on the suspicion of intramedullary astrocytoma , the laminectomy and tissue biopsy of 2 l , which showed yellowish color , were performed at the central portion of dorsal column in affected cervical cord lesion . postoperatively , patient 's neurologic deficits were not aggravated and , unexpectedly , the histology of biopsy revealed non - caseating granuloma without malignant cell ( fig . angiotesin converting enzyme ( ace ) was mildly elevated to 56 ( u / l ; normal , , there was no disease activity on other organs with using brain mri , chest and abdominal computed tomography and nerve conduction study ( ncs ) . the patient was treated with high - dose corticosteroid ( 60 mg / day ) followed by methotrexate ( 10 mg / week ) for over 2 yr . two years later , cervical spinal cord lesion was much improved in the spinal mri ( fig . 1d ) , however clinical symptoms of weakness and sensory change were not definitely improved . recently , the patient had to stop corticosteroid medication because of the cellulitis in the left leg . instead , we tried thalidomide 100 mg daily for 1 month with the goal of titrating up to 400 mg per day , which had been reported to be effective in the refractory neurosarcoidosis ( 11 ) . however the patient refused high - dose thalidomide due to severe fatigue and high cost , and just treated with low - dose thalidomide ( 100 mg / day ) and treatment did not show distinct effect in our patient . the spinal cord sarcoidosis is very rare and the diagnosis of this entity is difficult , as there are no pathognomic diagnostic study for neurosarcoidosis ( 3 , 12 , 13 ) . in general , this disease has been diagnosed clinically using mri , lumbar puncture and attendant laboratory tests , and the diagnosis is possible when systemic sarcoidosis is detected in other organs involving lung , kidney , eye and skin . spinal cord sarcoidosis may present as an idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease both clinically and radiologically ( 5 ) . only a positive biopsy of suspicious lesions in the central nervous system is considered to be definitive confirmation of the diagnosis of isolated neurosarcoidosis . zajicek and colleagues established a diagnostic classification system for neurosarcoidosis that distinguished ' definite ' , ' probable ' and ' possible ' neurosarcoidosis based on tissue evidence of non - caseating granuloma and supportive evidence of sarcoid pathology in laboratory and imaging studies ( 13 ) . however , biopsy should be cautiously considered if possible because of the risk involved in approaching the spinal cord . our patient was initially suspected to have intramedullary astrocytoma or multiple sclerosis based on neurologic symptoms and mri results . of course , the possibility of multiple sclerosis was not high because the clinical symptoms and cervical lesion were gradually progressive for months . the spinal cord biopsy was challenging procedure , nevertheless the cord biopsy and laminectomy were performed for diagnostic confirmation in the consent of patient , and the histology of which was unexpectedly consistent with sarcoidosis . the histology revealed multinucleated giant cells , lymphocytes and aggregated histiocytes within granulomatous inflammation , consistent with non - caseating granuloma seen in sarcoidosis . a few cases with neurosarcoidosis have been reported , however most cases suggested only clinical manifestation without histology , or demonstrated indirect biopsy in the brain , meninges and lymph node ( 6 - 10 ) . with an initial treatment , we tried high dose corticosteroid and immunosuppressant . systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are the treatment of choice for neurosarcoidosis , however which shows partial response especially in the spinal cord neurosarcoidosis ( 4 , 6 - 10 ) . unfortunately , 25% of neurosarcoidosis still have a refractory course with steroid treatment and , and 20%-40% of those refractory patients will not respond to current conventional immunosuppressant ( 3 ) . in our case , the clinical symptoms were initially severe and rapidly progressive , and therefore the combined therapy of high - dose corticosteroid and immunosuppressant was necessary . combination with immunosuppressant was useful to improve symptom control and reduce corticosteroid - related side effects in some cases . therefore , making a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was therapeutically essential , since corticosteroid and immunosuppressant treatment must be started and continued for years in order to prevent progression and permanent disability . a few reports have documented that the high - dose thalidomide ( 400 mg / day ) was effective in the refractory neurosarcoidosis ( 11 ) , and so we tried low - dose thalidomide ( 100 mg / day ) for one month in our patient . however there was no clear evidence that thalidomide was effective in our case of neurosarcoidosis , although there was limitation on the dosage and duration of treatment compared with other cases . our case indicates that diagnosis of spinal cord sarcoidosis is not easy and may require histological examination , and high - dose corticosteroid and immunosuppressant will be a good choice in the treatment of spinal cord sarcoidosis , and the thalidomide has to be debated in the treatment of spinal cord sarcoidosis . this is the first korean case , to our knowledge , which shows an isolated spinal cord sarcoidosis confirmed by direct tissue biopsy and good response to corticosteroid and immunosuppressant .\",\n",

the shortest postoperative interval was 2 days , recorded in 1974 , in which a para - prosthetic enteric fistula developed after resection of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with graft interposition . there are two types of saf ; type 1 or graft enteric fistula is more common ( 80% ) and is characterized by a direct connection between the bowel and the aortic lumen at the suture line , causing massive hemorrhage . type 2 , otherwise known as a para - prosthetic enteric fistula , is less common ( 20% ) and is characterized by communication between the bowel and perigraft region with a direct luminal connection . the pathogenesis of safs after prosthetic aortic grafting includes a low - grade infection , pseudoaneurysm formation caused by suture line failure , and failure of interposing viable tissue between the graft and the duodenum . repetitive pulsation of the graft against the duodenum may cause ischemia of the duodenal wall , leading to erosion and hemorrhage . any part of the gi canal may be involved , but the most common site is the third part of the duodenum ( 80% ) followed by its fourth part , then the jejunum and ileum . the initial  bouts of bleeding can recur over a period of hours , days , or weeks , eventually culminating in massive hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock . a high index of clinical suspicion based on the patient 's medical history and a thorough physical examination , is the key to a correct diagnosis . esophagogastroduodenoscopy is usually performed first for patients presenting with herald bleeding to exclude other causes of upper gi hemorrhage . bleeding arising from a point distal to the second part of the duodenum in the absence of a proximal lesion in patients with a history of aortic surgery could suggest an aef . ct / magnetic resonance angiogram is also useful for confirming the presence of abnormal communication between the prosthetic graft and the gi tract or for showing extraluminal gas in the periaortic region . bleeding may be intermittent making the diagnosis difficult and diagnostic tests often fail to reveal its course . the appropriate diagnostic method should be determined by the clinical presentation and high clinical suspicion in such patients with a history of aortic surgery is the most important tool . laparotomy should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is suspected with clot removal , graft revascularization , duodenorrhaphy and omentoplasty . secondary aef is a rare cause of gi hemorrhage associated with a high mortality rate . aefs should be considered in any patient with a history of abdominal aortic repair who presents with gi hemorrhage , no matter how minor . moreover , because these patients usually have other comorbid conditions such as coronary disease of hypertension , and diagnostic tests may be difficult or inconclusive , emergency surgery is mandatory to minimize mortality .\",\n",

2.40 mg / l ) , respectively . a chest ct scan confirmed the presence of several lymph node enlargements in the right axillary region ; the size of the largest enlargement was 3.53.0 cm ( figure 2 ) . an abdominal ct scan showed isodense homogeneous conglomerated para - aortic lymphadenopathy and a soft tissue density mass in the left pelvic cavity ( figure 3 ) . for a pathologic confirmation , an ultrasound - guided needle biopsy was performed on the left pelvic mass and the right axillary lymph node . a microscopic examination showed irregular nests of malignant lymphoma cells with hyperchromatic and round nuclei ( figure 4 ) . immunohistochemical staining showed cd79a positive and cd3 negative . according to the microscopic examination , a diagnosis of diffuse large b cell lymphoma a bone marrow examination showed no lymphoma cells , suggesting the absence of bone marrow involvement . nf1 is one of the most common inherited disorders in humans and mutation of the nf1 gene is thought to be the main contributor to nf1 development . the nf1 gene has been cloned and mapped to the human chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes a protein referred to as neurofibromin , which consists of 2,818 amino acids . although the functions of neurofibromin are not fully understood , it is known to contain a functional gtpase activating protein , ( gap)-related protein , and is homologous to gap , which regulates the hydrolysis of the active form , ras - gtp to the inactive form , ras - gdp . thus , neurofibromin may act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the function of oncogenic ras . although the clinical manifestations of nf1 are heterogeneous , even within patients a family , and only a small number of malignancies have been reported as a complications of this disorder , malignancy remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in nf1 . the estimation of the frequency of malignancy in nf1 is difficult because reported malignancies , may be independent of nf1 , per se . however , generally , nf1 is accepted to be related to the development of nervous system malignancies , including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( mpnst ) , optic glioma , and other gliomas . in addition , leukemia is also known to more prevalent in nf1 and many other malignant tumors have been proposed to be associated with nf1 such as , rhabdomyosarcoma and pheochromocytoma . stiller et al . reported an increased relative risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with nf1 in a population - based study . according to this study , five cases of non - hodgkin s lymphoma were developed over a 17 year - study period among all children in britain with leukemia or nhl ( non - hodgkin lymphoma ) diagnosed . few reports concern the development of malignant lymphoma in nf1 patients , though diffuse mixed t cell and b cell lymphoma have been reported . however , the mechanism of development of malignant lymphoma in nf1 remains unclear , though the mutation of nf1 leading to ras activation is believed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of cancer development . in a study of risk factor for malignancy in children with neurofibromatosis nevertheless , there is a possibility that the nf1 mutation may have a crucial role in the development of cancer . there is also evidence which indicates that mutations in other genes that predispose to malignancy in the general population may increase the risk of nf-1-associated malignancy . for example , vogel et al . reported that mice with mutant p53 and nf1 developed sarcoma and legius et al . found that p53 mutation was frequently observed in the tissue of human mpnst in addition to the nf1 mutation . in the presented case , immunohistochemical staining of lymphoma tissue showed that p53 expression was up - regulated by more than 80% , suggesting the presence of a p53 mutation ( figure 5 ) . thus , it is possible that the p53 mutation contributes to the development of non - hodgkin s lymphoma . because our patient was an 77 years old and her general health status was not good , we treated her with a chemotherapy regimen of cop ( cyclophosphamide 400 mg / m per oral on days 15 , vincristine 1.4 mg / m intravenous on day 1 and prednisolone 100 mg per oral on days 15 ) instead of chop . the maximal dosage of vincristine administered was 2 mg and the chemotherapy was repeated every 4 weeks . the lymph nodes and mass in the right axilla and left pelvic cavity were found to have markedly reduced after the completion of the first cycle chemotherapy . in summary , we experienced a rare case of a non - hodgkin s lymphoma in a patient with nf-1 , and we suggest a possible association between the two diseases . however , further study in necessary to evaluate the relationship between these disorders and the pathogenic mechanism of cancer development in nf1 .',\n",

       " {'article': \"acute renal failure can occur as a result of acute tubular necrosis secondary to acute oxalate nephropathy due to the deposition of calcium oxalate crystallization within the renal tubules .   primary hyperoxaluria is a group of autosomal recessively inherited enzymatic deficiencies that lead to the increased urinary excretion of oxalate . in type 1 primary hyperoxaluria , there is a reduction of alanine  :  glyoxylate aminotransferase ( agt ) activity in the liver , leading to an accumulation of oxalate . type 2 primary hyperoxaluria involves a mutation of glyoxylate reductase / d - glycerate dehydrogenase , leading to the excretion of increased amounts of l - glyceric acid as well as oxalate . secondary hyperoxaluria can occur due to increased dietary oxalate intake , increased absorption of oxalate from the bowel ( also known as enteric hyperoxaluria ) , and increased production of oxalate .   increased dietary intake of oxalate is fairly uncommon ; however , there have been case reports in the literature describing excessive star fruit juice ingestion [ 4 , 5 ] and peanut intake   leading to oxalate nephropathy .   enteric hyperoxaluria results mainly from fat malabsorption , which leads to increased absorption of soluble oxalate from the colon .   this reduces the normal calcium oxalate precipitation in the feces thereby allowing the absorption of soluble oxalate .   this mechanism of enteric hyperoxaluria is manifested in several ways , including with orlistat therapy [ 7 , 8 ] , roux - en - y gastric bypass surgery , celiac disease , and crohn 's disease .   increased production of oxalate is mainly due to increased levels of oxalate precursors , more commonly glyoxylate , which is associated with ethylene glycol ingestion , and less commonly ascorbic acid . we report , in detail , a case of a patient who presented with this rare occurrence of excessive vitamin c - induced oxalate nephropathy . our patient is a 72-year - old white male who was brought to the emergency department after being found down at home and confused .   on presentation , he was found to have a bun level of 102  mg / dl , a creatinine level of 10.6  mg / dl ( baseline bun 3.6  mg / dl and creatinine 1.3  mg / dl ) , and was also found to be oliguric .   an abg in the emergency department showed a ph of 7.19 , pco2 of 53 , hco3 of 21.4 , and a po2 of 77  mmhg on 2 liters of o2 via nasal cannula . his acidosis was attributed to the patient 's history of copd and chronic co2 retention . urinalysis in the emergency department showed 1 rbc / hpf , 1 + protein , and no wbc or microorganisms present . urine toxicology was positive for prescribed opiates and negative for recreational substances , including cocaine , ethanol , and amphetamines . his measured serum osmolality was 321  mosm / kg whereas his calculated osmolality was 3  mosm / kg . further history was difficult to attain given the fact that the patient was only alert to person but not to place or time . the patient was admitted to the medical icu and the nephrology service was consulted for further evaluation . due to his poor renal clearance , he was initiated on hemodialysis ( hd ) .   the patient 's mental status improved after about a week , and his kidney function continued to slowly improve .   during his hospital stay , the patient was found to have negative p - anca , c - anca , and qualitative ana values .   however , despite continued supportive therapy , the patient 's kidney function had not significantly recovered as expected .   the pathology report of the renal biopsy was consistent with findings of oxalate nephropathy as numerous tubules showed birefringent crystals shaped as plates or fine spicules under polarized light ( figure 1 ) .   there were also findings of moderate interstitial fibrosis , mild - to - moderate acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and mild hyaline and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis with moderate - to - severe arteriosclerosis . upon further questioning , the patient denied ingestion of any products containing ethylene glycol or any medications other than what was prescribed to him . however , the patient did mention that he had changed his eating habits within the past year as he wanted to include more leafy vegetables that incidentally were rich in oxalate .   he also admitted to ingesting between 1.9  l and 3.8  l per day of his favorite beverage for about 3 - 4 months prior to presentation . this beverage was an orange flavored powder drink , which had about 60  mg of vitamin c per 236.6  ml serving .   therefore , the patient was ingesting approximately 480  mg to 960  mg of vitamin c daily . the patient 's oxalate nephropathy was attributed to excessive vitamin c intake , which anecdotally has a poor prognosis . as the biopsy demonstrated significant interstitial inflammation , prednisone was started at 60  mg and tapered down for a period of six weeks . as described by ralli et al .   in the 1930s , vitamin c is excreted by the kidneys by filtration and active tubular reabsorption . the metabolism of vitamin c to oxalate was later described in the 1960s by other investigators [ 12 , 13 ] . since then , there have been several case reports in the literature mentioning acute oxalate nephropathy in association with excessive vitamin c intake . wong et al .   reports a patient with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate with underlying obstructive renal insufficiency who received a 60  gm bolus of iv vitamin c an an alternative therapy and developed anuric renal failure . two days later on renal biopsy , the patient had similar findings to our patient .   lawton et al .   also describes a patient with similar findings after a single administration of 45  gm of iv ascorbic acid as adjuvant therapy for primary amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome . in the 1970s , sullivan and eisenstein [ 15 , 16 ] demonstrated that dialysis patients tended to lose ascorbic acid during dialysis and as a result , should receive vitamin c supplementation . subsequently , there have been reports of cases of patients on dialysis who developed oxalate crystal deposition in various organs secondary to vitamin c supplementation .   vitamin c induced acute oxalate nephropathy has also been reported in the setting of patients who received parenteral alimentation .   friedman and associates   describe a patient with hemolytic uremic syndrome who was given total parenteral nutrition ( which included 500  mg / day of ascorbic acid ) while in the hospital . the patient ended up passing away with sepsis and severe metabolic acidosis about 4 months after being admitted . table 1 provides a summary of the various cases reported in the literature of biopsy proven oxalate nephropathy suspected to be secondary to ascorbic acid [ 10 , 14 , 1924 ] . our patient 's renal biopsy findings were similar to the biopsy findings mentioned in the cases above .   although vitamin c induced hyperoxaluria is not as common as ingestion of ethylene glycol leading to oxalate nephropathy , clinicians must consider the potential dangers of large dose ingestion of vitamin c in some individuals , especially those with underlying kidney disease or advanced age .    in conclusion , the use of vitamin c must be scrutinized closely both in patients with normal renal function and with underlying renal insufficiency .   according to auer et al . ,  surveys have indicated that about 66% of the general public take ascorbic acid either on its own or as part of a multivitamin preparation and that ingestion of megadoses of this vitamin in excess of the recommended daily allowance is common  .    this figure is extremely concerning given the increasing percentage of the general public developing chronic kidney disease .   we would like to add our case presentation to the literature as further evidence of this overlooked issue .   additionally , considering the improvement of our patient 's condition after being treated empirically with prednisone , it is crucial to further investigate the potential benefits and improvement of prognosis with prednisone therapy in the setting of oxalate nephropathy .\",\n",

treatment and post - treatment , and the control s scores and the patient s scores are presented in ( fig 2 ) . in this study , four acupuncture points were used , cv4 , cv1 , bl23 and bl24 . cv4 is the front collecting point ( mu point ) of the small intestine and represents the intersection of the interior branches of the three yin channels of the foot . it can explain the broad effect on gynecological syndromes and disorders of the urogenital tract . also , it can play an important role in tonifying in cases of emotional and physical exhaustion . in traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) , it can nourish blood and yin , warm the uterus and lower warmer , invigorate kidney , yang and original qi ( yuan qi ) , and expel dampness and cold from the lower warmer . cv1 is the beginning point of the governing vessel , the penetrating vessel and the conception vessel . thus , its effect lies in difficult urination and defecation , enuresis and impotence , pain in the penis , sweating of genitals , etc . bl23 is the back shu point of the kidney , so its indication lies in strengthening the renal function and circulation , and its point is used for all chronic diseases including disorders of the urogenital tract   bl24 is one of the back shu points , and its action strengthens the lower back , regulates menstruation , and invigorates blood ; especially , it is useful for lower backache and stiffness of the lower back . the iief questionnaire is composed of 15 questions , and it is a useful tool in a clinical setting . it is a validated , multidimensional , self - reporting questionnaire and can be used to evaluate erectile function and treatment outcomes . the 15 questions can be classified into 5 categories : erectile function , orgasmic function , sexual desire , intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction . for example question numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 15 can be categorized as erectile function . the perfect score differs according to the category , being 30 for erectile function , 10 for orgasmic function , 10 for sexual desire , 15 for satisfaction with intercourse , and 10 for overall satisfaction . in this case study , the patient s scores in each category were similar to those of the control group , except for sexual desire , where the patient s scores were very low . after treatment , the results showed improved erectile function , sexual desire , satisfaction with intercourse , and overall satisfaction . based on the patient s subjective self - evaluation , he also showed improvements in the duration of erection , hardness ( vascularity ) of the penis , and shortening of recovery period ( re - action ) , his lower back pain decreased , the flow of urine when urinating was not interrupted , and generally he felt more confident in his life . although such sign as eye contact , brightness of eyes , volume of his voice , etc . are subjective , in this circumstance , a personal problem , observing such features may be helpful . this study has limitations in that the result of 1 case can not be generalized because of loss of control and insufficient number of subjects . besides the iief questionnaire , no other signs of improvement , such as pulse diagnosis , digital thermal imaging test , etc . nevertheless , this study could be regarded as helpful to broaden the scope for using sbv pharmacopuncture to treat urogenital diseases . in the future , additional systematic research or randomized clinical trials in this area will be needed to find the ways to treat sexual problems using pharmacopuncture and korean medicine treatments .',\n",

2 point mutations in gyra and 1 in parc confer fluoroquinolone resistance ( 8,1012 ) . further studies , including characterization of other resistance mechanisms , are needed to track the evolution of fluoroquinolone - resistant s. enterica serotype typhi . although the ciprofloxacin resistance we detected using current clsi criteria is rare in s. enterica serotype typhi , nalidixic acid resistance , which correlates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin , has increased ( 7 ) . clinicians should be aware that infection with salmonella spp . with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin may not respond satisfactorily to this agent ( 6,8,9,13,15 ) . in addition , identification of ciprofloxacin - resistant cases has been increasing . in the presence of quinolone resistance , third - generation cephalosporins , such as ceftriaxone , recent clinical trials suggest that azithromycin might be useful for treating uncomplicated typhoid fever ( 2,8,9,15 ) . recommendations for empiric treatment of typhoid fever in the united states are best developed by using information about antimicrobial resistance trends in isolates from countries where the infection was acquired .',\n",

lumen balloon catheter ( microvention , tustin , ca , usa ) , the aneurysm was temporarily trapped for 30 min , without any clinical change in the patient . during after bto , single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) was performed . in brain spect , decreased diffuse perfusion was seen in the left hemisphere . on the 4 day after admission , limitation of the left eye movement became aggravated , except for minimal lateral movement . for endovascular treatment , the patient was administered aspirin ( 100 mg ) and clopidogrel ( 75 mg ) from the time of admission . five days later , the p2y12 reaction units value was 331 and the aspirin reaction units value was 551 in the verifynow system ( accriva diagnostics , san diego , ca , usa ) , indicating low responsiveness to both of these agents . thus , endovascular treatment was delayed to the 9 day of admission , with addition of cilostazol 200 mg per day ( i.e. , triple antiplatelet therapy ) . thereafter , we opted for treatment using an endovascular approach . after gaining access to the left petrous ica with a 7f shuttle sheath ( cook , bloomington , in , usa ) and a 6f envoy guiding catheter ( cordis , miami lakes , fl , usa ) , a covered stent of 3.5 mm  19 mm in size ( graftmaster rx ; abbott , il , usa ) was placed in the cavernous ica between the anterior genu and the horizontal segment . after deployment of the stent , the aneurysm was still filled with contrast medium through the remnant neck of the aneurysm . therefore , partially overlapping stenting , using another 4 mm  19 mm covered stent , was performed proximal to the previous deployed stent . after balloon angioplasty , follow - up angiography showed that the aneurysm had disappeared ( fig . three weeks after endovascular treatment , a verifynow test was performed during follow - up . the p2y12 reaction units value was 280 , which indicated resistance to clopidogrel , but the aspirin reaction units value was 380 , indicating responsiveness . therefore , brain ct angiography was performed , which revealed recurrence of the giant aneurysm and venous reflux . 3 ) . to locate the leakage point , several attempts of superselective angiography using an echelon-10 microcatheter ( ev3 neurovascular , inc . , irvine , ca , usa ) were made . angioplasty was performed through the left ica using a gateway balloon ( boston scientific , san leandro , ca , usa ) , but there was no interval change in the angiography . the microcatheter was then introduced into the left distal ica via an a - com channel from the right ica . after several attempts , we succeeded in selecting the aneurysm through the gap between the stent and ica . although we endeavored to pack the aneurysm with coils , it remained insufficiently packed . after 1 week , we noted low density in the left temporal lobe on brain ct , which was thought to reflect a venous infarction ( fig . we attempted to approach the aneurysm via an a - com and p - com channel , and via the inferior petrosal sinus , but these approaches failed . hence , as part of a planned internal trapping , the area from the distal part of the covered stent to the ophthalmic artery was temporally occluded using a scepter c dual - lumen balloon catheter . after the distal part of the covered stent to the ophthalmic artery was occluded using the scepter c balloon , angiography revealed choroidal blush and disappearance of the ccf . after trapping , angiography revealed complete occlusion of the ica from the region proximal to the stent to the region distal to the ophthalmic artery , aneurysm , and ccf ( fig . because of the small caliber of the parietal branch , a double - barrel bypass was performed . although mild ptosis remained , the patient achieved a stable condition . during clinical follow - up for another 6 months , no neurological abnormality recurred . after gaining access to the left petrous ica with a 7f shuttle sheath ( cook , bloomington , in , usa ) and a 6f envoy guiding catheter ( cordis , miami lakes , fl , usa ) , a covered stent of 3.5 mm  19 mm in size ( graftmaster rx ; abbott , il , usa ) was placed in the cavernous ica between the anterior genu and the horizontal segment . after deployment of the stent , the aneurysm was still filled with contrast medium through the remnant neck of the aneurysm . therefore , partially overlapping stenting , using another 4 mm  19 mm covered stent , was performed proximal to the previous deployed stent . after balloon angioplasty , follow -

mca bypass in case the first treatment attempt consisting of ica occlusion via an endovascular approach failed . depending on the individual case , various materials , such as detachable balloons , coils , liquid material , and stents can be used.6)9)11)13)18)21 ) currently , the covered stent is the preferred treatment option.1)8)12)16)20 ) however , spontaneous ica occlusion and endoleaks frequently occur after placement of a covered stent.1)8)12)16)20 ) the covered stents in current use were designed for coronary arteries , and may be too stiff to navigate distal to the lesion and fit the cavernous siphon of the ica appositely , frequently resulting in endoleaks . reported endoleaks in 3 of 8 cases.1 ) wang et al.20 ) and li et al.12 ) both reported 2 of 10 cases that were not resolved with balloon angioplasty.20 many of these patients required further treatment , such as aneurysm coiling or ica trapping.12)16)20 ) in the case described here , the neck of the aneurysm included a wide area of the cavernous ica , from the anterior genu to the horizontal segment . it was covered using two covered stents . immediately after deployment of the stent , endoleak of contrast agent after balloon angioplasty , the endoleak disappeared . at that time , it appeared that the ccf had been treated appropriately using the covered stent . however , the ccf recurred during the follow - up period , due to endoleak . wang et al . explained that recurrence of the ccf is related to spasm.20 ) however , in this case , the ccf recurred after 6 months , with relapse symptoms . we believe that recoiling the covered stent in the anterior genu of the cavernous ica led to a gradual increase in the gap between the covered stent and the ica . during endovascular retreatment , coil embolization of the gca was attempted ; however , this failed . fortunately , there was collateral blood flow from the external carotid artery to the retina , so that endovascular trapping of the ica with ophthalmic artery occlusion was possible . therefore , in cases with aneurysms having a wide neck or located in the carotid syphon , it may not be possible to obtain good results with these stents . the experience from this case suggests the use of possibly more efficient alternative treatment options , such as stent - assisted coiling or a combination of covered stent and coiling . there is a need for development of new materials for use with covered stents for gcas , taking into consideration the anatomical structure of the ica . during endovascular treatment , antiplatelet agent dual therapy consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel clopidogrel is activated in the body in two steps , and many factors , including genetic variation , influence these steps . insufficiency of p2y12 receptor inhibition , despite usual doses , is defined as clopidogrel resistance or high on - clopidogrel platelet reactivity ( hpr).2 ) in hpr patients , there is a tendency for frequent stent - related thromboembolic events during percutaneous coronary intervention.7)14 ) in the cardiology field , studies are researching the usefulness of drug reinforcement therapy . a similar situation may also occur during neurointervention.3)4 ) compared with the typical stents used for coil embolization , covered stents may have a higher thromboembolic risk . in our case , changing the drugs to a second generation p2y12 inhibitor or an antiplatelet agent with distinct characteristics may prevent thromboembolic events . however , there are currently no clear guidelines for interpretation of the results or for use of antiplatelet medication . in this case , the procedure was completed without any complications during or after treatment using triple antiplatelet therapy . in a case of ccf from gca after placement of a covered stent , it was possible to treat the ccf using endovascular trapping and surgical bypass .\",\n",

normal value range : 8.210.4 mg / dl ) and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels ( 576 u / l ; normal value range : 230460 was considered a complicated right inguinal hernia , and the patient was admitted for surgical management . surprisingly , the operation revealed an inoperable mass anterior to the peritoneal sheaths , and a biopsy was taken for histological examination . the macroscopic examination reported a firm mass measuring 1.6  1.2  0.8 cm with grayish white cut surface . analysis of the haematoxylin - eosin - stained sections revealed a malignant pleomorphic mesenchymal neoplasm , characterized mainly by proliferation of atypical spindle and few epithelioid cells , in a plexiform pattern , admixed with giant multinucleated cells with abundant eosinophilic nucleoli ( fig . immunohistochemistry displayed strong and diffuse positive stains for smooth muscle actin , vimentin , and cd99 , and focally positive nuclear and cytoplasmic stains for myo d1 and myogenin ( fig . some cells were positive for desmin , and 60% of the tumour cells expressed mdm-2 protein . the combination of the above findings supported the diagnosis of a high - grade pleomorphic rms . the tumour staging , using abdominal and chest ct scan , revealed enlarged right common iliac and external iliac lymph nodes , invading the right obturator internus muscle and measuring up to 8.7 cm in diameter , with central hypodense areas consisting of necrotic foci . a bone scan was negative for bone involvement but showed marked radionuclide uptake at the periphery of the inguinal mass . the patient 's neoplasm was staged as group iv according to the international rms study group ( irsg ) surgical - pathologic grouping system , and as stage 4 according to the irsg staging system ( table 1 and table 2 ) . however , his performance status had already deteriorated to 2 due to the rapid growth of the right pelvic mass ( 12 and 19 cm in the transverse and the longitudinal diameter , respectively ) causing considerable oedema and leg pain . chemotherapy was immediately administered using the vac regimen ( vincristine , actinomycin - d , and cyclophosphamide ) in 4 cycles . re - evaluation by ct scans revealed that the disease had further advanced to the lung and the pelvis , and new secondary lesions were identified in the liver . a second - line chemotherapy was administered ( ifosfamide and etoposide ) in 3 cycles . however , the patient 's symptoms continued to deteriorate , although there was no evidence of significant toxicity from the treatment . the whole situation was thoroughly discussed with the patient and his family , and the decision was to discontinue chemotherapy and administer only symptomatic treatment . rmss are a group of different pathobiologic entities linked by a common characteristic : to form neoplastic skeletal muscle . this is derived from biological forces related to aberrant transcription signals that lead to the production of myogenic proteins . these differing morphologic features were recognized in the mid-1900s by horn and enterline , who divided rmss into embryonal , alveolar , botryoid , and pleomorphic subtypes . however , recent histologic and molecular studies led to the description of additional entities , such as spindle cell and anaplastic rmss . following further refinements of the original entities , using molecular biology , as a consequence , botryoid and spindle cell rmss were assigned to the superior - prognosis group , embryonal rmss to the intermediate - prognosis group , and alveolar rmss to the poor - prognosis group . however , pleomorphic rmss were not included in this classification , as they concerned the paediatric population in which the pleomorphic subtype is a very rare entity [ 3 , 7 ] . pleomorphic rmss occur predominately in middle - aged men ( median age : 5456 years ) and are mostly located in the lower extremity . less frequent sites of presentation are the abdomen , retroperitoneum , chest wall , spermatic cord / testes , upper extremity , mouth , and orbit [ 8 , 9 ] . they typically have an aggressive clinical course , demonstrating an overall poor prognosis [ 8 , 9 ] . given the rarity of the disease and the lack of large prospective controlled studies , very few related data are available , deriving from studies with small numbers of patients . furlong et al .   reported 38 pleomorphic rms cases ( 28 men and 10 women ) . these patients presented with a rapidly growing mass ( with a median size of 6.9 cm ) involving mainly the lower extremity . the response to treatment was rather poor as approximately 70% of the patients died of the disease within 20 months . the progression - free survival of 45% of these patients was reported to be 9 months . gaffney et al .   reported 11 pleomorphic rms cases ( 10 men and 1 woman ; median age : 56 years ) with the thigh being the most common site of disease presentation . from the 8 cases that had clinical follow - up , 1 patient was alive 20 months after the initial diagnosis , whereas the remaining 7 patients had died 228 months following diagnosis . in the study by ferrari et al . , localized pleomorphic rms was found in 37 patients ( 20% of the total rms population ) , and complete surgical resection was possible for 74% of these patients ( compared to 30% for other rms histologic subtypes ) . overall , the 5-year event - free survival and overall survival rates were 29.9 and 53.4% for the pleomorphic rmss compared to 32.9 and 45.7% , respectively , for the non - pleomorphic rmss . however , these results correspond to the localized rather than the metastatic setting , which was the case in our patient . in the same study , it has been suggested that when the paediatric treatment guidelines are followed in adult patients , the response rates are comparable to those observed in children . according to the major conclusions derived from the meta - analysis of the intergroup rms studies i  iv , vac remains the standard regimen for patients with advanced disease . the underlying aetiology of the poor prognosis in this disease is not yet well understood . reports regarding prognostic and predictive factors of adult pleomorphic rms patients are very few and contradictory . little et al .   suggest that pleomorphic rms is the most common rms subtype in adults , accounting for 43% of the rms population with locoregional disease . pleomorphic rmss were grouped and analyzed together with embryonal rmss ( a total of 63 patients ) and did not show significant differences in terms of progression - free survival or overall survival compared to the alveolar subtype . nevertheless , metastasis - free survival was slightly higher for the pleomorphic / embryonal group ( 58 vs. 32% for the alveolar group , p = 0.04 ) . in another study , joshi et al .   reported that increasing age is a negative prognostic factor among children with rmss . on the other hand , a retrospective analysis from the surveillance , epidemiology and end results database of 205 adults and 17 children with pleomorphic rmss , which was recently published by sultan et al . , concluded that adult patients with pleomorphic rmss demonstrate a worse prognosis , and that this is irrespective of the site of origin of the tumour or the histological subtype . it is noteworthy that there were exceptionally few children with pleomorphic rmss in this database , and that these had a risk to die twice as high as adults ( hr 3.73 vs.1.79 , p < 0.001 ) . in accordance with previous studies , our patient had a pleomorphic rms with highly malignant features , progressing very quickly and not responding to aggressive chemotherapy . these findings further support our previous suggestion that these patients should be managed in specialized centres in order to receive optimal treatment and participate in large , well - designed , prospective trials to analyze prognostic factors and histological features that are still controversial .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'their activity is mediated by an androgen receptor ( ar ) , which translocates to the nucleus and binds to the regulatory regions of specific chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) sequences ( androgen response elements ) , to activate androgen dependent genes . the gene is formed by 8 exons and 7 introns , spanning more than 90 kb and codes for a protein with four functional domains . these are ( a ) exon 1 encoding the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) , which serves modulatory function ( 1586 bp ) ; ( b ) exons 2 and 3 encode the dna - binding domain ( dbd ) ( 152 bp and 117 bp ) ; ( c ) the  hinge  region , which binds the ntd and dbd and consists of residues 628 - 669 ; ( d ) exons 4 - 8 encode the c - terminal ligand - binding domain ( lbd ) , which vary from 131 bp to 288 bp in size . mutations in the ar lbd perturb the conformation of the helix , which is unable to efficiently bind the ligand dihydrotestosterone ( dht ) and to transactivate known androgen response elements . disorders of ar function due to mutations in the ar gene cause different forms of x - linked male pseudohermaphroditism , known as androgen insensitivity syndromes ( ais ) affecting xy female individuals with the normal androgen production and metabolisms . ais are estimated to be present in 1:20000 - 64000 male births . the presence of variable phenotypic expression allows the classification of ais into complete androgen insensitivity syndrome ( cais ) , partial androgen insensitivity and mild androgen insensitivity . approximately , 90% of molecular defects in the ar gene are single base mutations , mostly missense mutations . in addition to the point mutations , the ar gene contains regions of repetitive dna sequences , trinucleotide repeat cag and ggn that have been associated with a number of disorders , such as androgen insensitivity , male infertility and prostate cancer . here , we describe a familial case of cais presenting with similar mutations described in 3 generations . a 10-year - old girl , product of consanguineous marriage was referred for evaluation of palpable gonads in the inguinal region . she was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy by normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 2.6 kg and length of 48 cm . she was followed - up over a period of 8 months when assignment of the female gender was decided ; corrective procedure for inguinal gonads was planned , but did not occur . on physical examination , she had typical female external genitalia . palpable gonads were found bilaterally in the inguinal region [ figure 1 ] , pubertal stage was b4p5 . hormonal evaluation revealed follicle stimulating hormone ( 5.4 miu / ml ; normal : 1.5 - 12.4 ) , luteinizing hormone ( 21.2 miu / ml ; normal : 1.7 - 8.6 ) and total testosterone ( 15 ng / ml ; normal : 2.86 - 8.1 ) ; chromosomal analysis showed diploid 46 xy karyotype . testosterone and dht synthesis defects were excluded by the normal rise of t and dht after human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) stimulation ( basal t : 15 ng / ml ; basal dht : 9.3 ng / ml , t / dht ratio after hcg stimulation : 7:9 ) . gonadectomy was performed a few months later and histological analysis revealed bilateral testes with no evidence of malignancy . three maternal aunts presented with primary amenorrhea with an adequate breast and pubic hair development and palpable gonads in the age group between 15 and 20 years and were treated with bilateral gonadectomy , vaginal reconstruction and estrogen supplementation . female appearing external genitalia with bilateral inguinal gonads peripheral blood samples were obtained from the girl and her maternal family members for molecular analysis . genomic dna was extracted with the use of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplification of ar exonic fragments 1 - 8 followed by direct sequencing analysis of the pcr products was performed . the same mutation was confirmed in her mother and the 3 maternal aunts [ figure 3 ] , maternal grandmother [ figure 4 ] . chromosomal and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis of the patient showing 46 xy karyotype with c 2754 to t transition of exon 6 chromosomal and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis of the parents and maternal aunts . 3 affected maternal aunts showing 46 xy karyotype with c 2754 to t transition of exon 6 . mother is showing similar mutation with 46 xx karyotype , a fertile carrier chromosomal and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis of the maternal grandmother showing 46 xx karyotype with c 2754 to t transition of exon 6 the phenotype variability appears to reflect the degree to which ligand - binding and receptor functions are disrupted by different substitutions . in addition , genetic background also influences the resulting phenotype since a same mutation may cause different forms of ais within a family . the most frequent are missense mutations that are found within two important areas of the receptor protein : dbd and ldb domains . out of 193 mutations , 103 causing cais are located in the lbd , 51 in the n - terminal and 24 in the dbd mutations of a single amino acid in the lbd of the ar can induce functional abnormalities in androgen binding , stabilization of active conformation or interaction with co - activators . in the ar c - terminal lbd , there is a clear predominance of missense mutations . in our case mutation , which has been previously reported previously , alters a gln codon to a termination codon ( q798x ) . this results in the interruption of the amino acid sequence of the ar within the lbd between helices vii and viii . the truncated form of the receptor is devoid of 123 amino acids at the carboxyl end , a major part of the lbd and the at2 sequence responsible for the activation of the transcription . the previously reported lady had sertoli cell adenoma in both gonads , which was lacking in our patient . the characterization of mutations in the ar gene serves as a reliable tool for the diagnosis and molecular subclassification of ais . in addition to the localization of the mutation within the gene sequence , the kind of amino acid substitution in mutation affects the resulting phenotype . knowledge of the mutation in the ar and its functional consequences can provide useful information about the genotype - phenotype correlation , improving the management of cases of male pseudohermaphroditism pertinent to gender assignment , genital surgery and gonadectomy .',\n",

nmdar encephalitis develops fever , headache , abnormal behavior , memory loss , autonomic dysfunction , seizure , hypoventilation , and dyskinesia . sometimes the patient is misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia because of behavioral disturbance.4 lim et al . reported that , in korea , the most frequently presented symptoms of patients were psychiatric ( 68.8% ) followed by epileptic seizure ( 50.0%).5 although anti -

up brain mri was performed at 10 months from the onset of her clinical symptoms . brain mri showed diffuse brain atrophy and bilateral hippocampal atrophy on fluid attenuation inversion recovery ( flair ) images and t2 weighted images(t2wi ) . however , there was continuous improvement in the cognitive function and the follow - up modified rankin scale ( mrs ) score was 1 at one year from the onset of her symptoms . however , we failed to detect the ovarian teratoma using transabdominal ultrasonography . according to research , variable accuracy of diagnostic value on ovarian teratoma using ultrasonogram reported a sensitivity of 57.9% and specificity of 99.7% in diagnosing mature cystic teratoma using transvaginal ultrasonography.7 patel et al . reported that the combination of transabdominal ultrasonogram and transvagianal ultrasonogram showed 85% sensitivity for the diagnosis and identification of cystic teratoma.8 also , we did not conduct the abdominal - pelvic mri in the emergency room . we did not have sufficient time to perform abdominal - pelvic mri in the early period of the disease . after two weeks of admission , the nmdar ab was found to be positive , and we finally detected ovarian teratoma with the abdominal - pelvic ct after her fetus had miscarried . however , although treatment required a long period of time , her mental status and cognition gradually improved and were nearly normal at the follow - up after one year from the onset of symptoms . anti - nmdar encephalitis in pregnant women has been rarely reported.9,10 however , anti - nmdar encephalitis in pregnant women has recently been more frequently reported with growing concern about anti - nmdar encephalitis . also , developmental outcomes have more frequently reported that fetuses and babies have been born from mothers with anti - nmdar encephalitis . chan et al . reported anti - nmdar encephalitis in a pregnant woman who miscarried within 2 days of hospitalization.11 in another case of anti - nmdar encephalitis in a pregnant woman , jagota et al . reported that the baby showed nmdr antibody titer at the same level as that of the mother 2 days after birth and was negative at 1 year.12 also , the baby showed developmental delay and cortical dysplasia in a brain mri it is unclear whether the causes of delayed development and cortical dysplasia are the transfer of maternal antibodies , materanal medication , or the indirect effect of maternal illness . reported that nmdar antibodies were capable of maternal - fetal transfer and reported appropriate development of a baby at one year.13 kumar et al . reported three cases of anti - nmdar encephalitis in pregnant women.14 these three patients developed symptoms between 8 and 17 weeks . in one of these patients , who had bilateral ovarian teratoma and severe neurological complications , the pregnancy was terminated . however , two of these patients gave birth to normal babies . the authors suggested the good outcome of these two neonates was related to the period of transplacental transfer of immunoglobulin g ( igg ) . igg1 and g3 cross the placenta by binding to fc neonatal receptor present in the syncytiotrophoblast and this process of placental transfer occurs at around 14 to 16 weeks.15 this results in a very low level of fetal blood igg at the time of onset of clinical symptoms . additionally , the fetal blood - brain barrier becomes functional by the end of the second trimester , and this is one of the reasons for the delivery of a normal baby . in summary , this case highlighted the importance of active attempts to detect the ovarian teratoma in pregnant women with anti - nmdar encephalitis . if pregnancy limits the use of a radiologic diagnostic tool such as abdomen - pelvic ct , an abdominal - pelvic mri should be performed as early as possible . lastly , the clinician should be concerned about the best way to determine a fetal developmental outcome .',\n",

old female a known case of lymphocytic thyroiditis for 2 years presented to surgery outpatient department with the complaints of a sudden increase in size of thyroid swelling since last 1-month . there was no history of pain , change in voice , difficulty in deglutition / breathing , cold or heat intolerance , change in appetite and palpitations . on examination , a diffuse nontender thyroid swelling measuring 4 cm  2 cm moving with deglutition was noted involving the entire thyroid gland . multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted on both sides ( size < 0.5 cm ) . fine needle aspiration smears from the thyroid [ figure 1 ] were highly cellular comprising predominantly of monomorphic population of medium to large sized lymphoid cells with high nuclear / cytoplasmic ( n / c ) ratio and scant cytoplasm . nuclei were round to oval with fine chromatin , few of them showing irregular nuclear membrane , 0 - 2 eccentrically located nucleoli . few centrocytes , small mature lymphocytes , occasional tingible body macrophages , plasma cells and mast cells along with lymphoglandular bodies were seen in the background . highly cellular fine needle aspiration smear comprising predominantly of the monomorphic population of medium to large sized lymphoid cells with high nuclear / cytoplasmic ratio and scant cytoplasm ( giemsa , 400 ) trucut biopsy from the thyroid gland was also performed , which predominantly showed monomorphic medium to large sized lymphoid population with increased n / c ratio and scant cytoplasm , round to oval nuclei with irregular nuclear membrane , open chromatin , 0 -

hodgkin 's lymphoma possibly centroblastic variant of diffuse large b - cell lymphoma was given . contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( cect ) of neck and abdomen was done to differentiate between primary and secondary thyroid lymphoma which showed enlarged and homogenously enhancing left and right thyroid lobe with multiple enlarged homogenously enhancing lymph nodes in bilateral level 2 - 4 and posterior triangle of neck , bilateral supraclavicular , pre / para tracheal , trachea - esophageal region ( size < 0.5 cm ) , possibility of thyroid lymphoma was considered . no organomegaly or abdominal lymphadenopathy was noticed . the primary thyroid lymphoma occurs in older age group ( median age : 60 years ) , limited to thyroid and usually originates in setting of autoimmune thyroiditis . on the contrary , in secondary thyroid lymphoma ( i.e. , the thyroid being secondarily affected by lymphoma ) , the middle - aged population ( median age : 42 years ) is affected more , usually patient presents with disseminated disease and has no complaints of thyroiditis . more common subtype comprising up to 70% of cases is a diffuse large b - cell lymphoma . another subtype includes mucosa associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphoma forming 6 - 27% of thyroid lymphomas . these have relatively indolent course and male to female ratio of 2 - 4:1 . majority of these have underlying hashimoto 's thyroiditis that increases the risk of thyroid lymphoma by 50 times . two subtypes of diffuse large b - cell lymphomas ( dlbcl ) can be distinguished histologically . \\n malt lymphoma secondarily transformed into an aggressive dlbcl at the time of diagnosis.dlbcl without associated marginal zone lymphoma ( mzl ) lesions.patients with dlbcl and malt lymphomas generally have a previous history of thyroid disease . however , clinical course of dlbcl evolving from malt and dlbcl without associated mzl lesions seem to be similar . our case does not show any features of malt lymphoma and appears to be dlbcl originating in the background of lymphocytic thyroiditis . nearly half of the thyroid non - hodgkin 's lymphomas have a clinical history of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and up to two thirds of cases show pathological clues consistent with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis . it is thought that lymphomas originating in this wide variety of primary sites represent a malignant transformation of acquired lymphocytic tissue during the course of a chronic inflammatory or an autoimmune process . diffuse large b - cell lymphomas in cytology show a population of noncohesive atypical cells . these are large cells with irregular nuclear membrane , vesicular nuclei , and prominent nucleoli . there is scant to absent thyroid follicular cells with scattered small cytoplasmic fragments of lymphocytes in background ( lymphoglandular bodies ) as seen in our case . another important differential diagnosis of dlbcl thyroid is anaplastic carcinoma that shows pleomorphic , round , oval or spindle - shaped cells either isolated or in tissue fragments . lack of cohesion and absence of lymphoglandular bodies with ck and ema negativity pointed strongly against anaplastic carcinoma . hypothyroidism at the time of diagnosis is found in 30 - 40% of patients due to replacement of thyroid parenchyma by the lymphomatous process due to underlying hashimoto 's thyroiditis . the choice of treatment in thyroid lymphoma depends on histological subtype and stage of the disease . for aggressive dlbcl treatment is based on chemotherapy ( chop ) with anthracycline containing multidrug regimen ( chop / chop like ) . combination of chop and radiotherapy is the standard treatment of localized aggressive lymphoma but in some patients under 60 years and without any adverse prognostic factors chop alone may be proposed . our patient was in stage 2a till now and had received three cycles of r - chop following which the ct was performed which showed regression of size of the thyroid and disappearance of cervical lymph nodes . to conclude , large cell lymphoma like dlbcl can easily be diagnosed on fine needle aspiration so that a timely intervention can be undertaken . any rapid or short history of thyroid enlargement as present in our case should alarm the clinician for an urgent fine needle aspiration to rule out development of lymphoma in the background of thyroiditis .\",\n",

       " {'article': \"epiphrenic diverticula are rare disorders of the oesophagus , which are symptomatic in only 1520% of cases . they are usually found in the lower third of the oesophagus in middle - aged or elderly persons . standard treatment of the epiphrenic diverticulum includes diverticulectomy , oesophageal myotomy with or without antireflux operation with left thoracotomy being the recommended approach . the high morbidity associated with thoracotomy means that only persons with disabling symptoms or complications should be treated . asymptomatic patients should be left untreated , because few asymptomatic patients will present symptoms at follow - up . recent advances in minimal access surgery have led to the application of this technique for the management of epiphrenic diverticula . it dramatically reduces the morbidity of the procedure and is associated with less pulmonary complications , minimal pain and shorter hospital of stay . we have previously published our own institute 's experience in minimally invasive management of lower oesophageal diverticula . now with increasing emphasis on patient comfort and cosmesis , surgeons have decreased the number of incisions used in laparoscopic surgery and thus the era of single incision laparoscopy has begun . many procedures such as cholecystectomy , appendicectomy , colectomy and others have been done successfully using single incision laparoscopy and have proven to be safe and advantageous compared with conventional laparoscopy . the patient was a 57-year - old man with 6 months history of dysphagia and regurgitation . upper gastrointestinal ( ugi ) endoscopy was done which showed large wide mouthed diverticulum in lower oesophagus around 36 cm from the incisors . the mucosa within the lumen of diverticulum was normal and there was no other lesion in oesophagus , stomach or duodenum . subsequently , barium swallow and contrast enhanced computerised tomography chest and abdomen were done which confirmed the diagnosis of epiphrenic diverticulum measuring 5 cm in maximum diameter arising from posterolateral wall of oesophagus around 4 cm above the gastro esophageal junction . oesophageal manometry showed diffuse increase in pressure tracings with hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter but normal peristalsis and les relaxation with swallow . the patient was taken up for surgery based on the severity of symptoms and objective findings . a laparoscopic transhiatal oesophageal diverticulectomy with myotomy through single incision was planned . patient was kept on liquid diet 1 day prior to surgery and was fasting overnight . operation was performed under general anaesthesia with patient supine and legs apart with steep reverse trendelenberg tilt . the surgeon stood between the legs of the patient with a camera assistant to the left and scrub nurse to the right of the surgeon . a 4 cm transverse skin incision was made within the umblicus and deepened upto the anterior rectus sheath . pneumoperitoneum was created using veress needle and a 10 mm trocar for laparoscope was placed in the centre of the incision . two 5 mm trocars were placed on either side for the working instruments creating a mini triangulation effect [ figure 1 ] . initial peritoneoscopy was done and then left lobe of liver was retracted by placing heavy double armed silk onstraight needle through a corrugated plastic drain and brought out through the liver parenchyma and the anterior abdominal wall [ figure 2 ] . the dissection started with opening up of the avascular gastrohepatic omentum and division of phrenoesophageal membrane and gastrophrenic attachments of the fundus . an umbilical tape was placed and tied around the ge junction after this dissection and brought out through the right trocar for traction during circumferential mobilisation of the oesophagus . the diverticulum was freed upto its neck , 5 mm right lateral trocar was replaced by a 12 mm trocar and the diverticulum was then divided with two firings of 60 mm linear stapler with a blue cartridge [ figure 3 ] . an anterior oesophageal myotomy was done starting from 6 cm above ge junction and extending 2 cm into the stomach . the mucosal integrity was once again confirmed with endoscopy and air leak test was done . finally , the specimen was placed in a plastic bag and extracted and drain was placed . were closed with no 1 loop nylon and skin with subcuticular absorbable suture [ figure 4 ] . retraction of liver with corrugated plastic drain firing gi stapler across diverticulum postoperative photograph epiphrenic diverticula of oesophagus are considered to be pulsion diverticula caused by increased intra oesophageal pressure secondary to motility disorder . functional obstruction at the lower end of oesophagus is thought to be the major cause of symptoms such as dysphagia , heartburn and regurgitation . since majority of the diverticula are asymptomatic or producing mild symptoms , conservative approach is advocated . the traditional accepted surgery used to be an oesophageal diverticulectomy with long myotomy with or without an antireflux procedure performed through a left thoracotomy . this removed the diverticula , took care of the underlying motility disorder and post operative reflux . but this procedure was associated with significant morbidity and mortality which was not acceptable for a benign disorder . minimal invasive surgery led to use of thoracoscopy for excision of oesophageal diverticula but it was complicated by technical difficulty and inability to perform an adequate distal myotomy . laparoscopy has been established as the gold standard for a variety of oesophageal disorders like achalasia , hiatal hernia and severe gastro esophageal reflux disease . the transhiatal laparoscopic approach is ideally suited for management of lower oesophageal diverticula as it avoids the morbidity of thoracic approach . it affords excellent view of the lower mediastinum and allows comfortable alignment of the laparoscopic instruments along the hiatus . the performance of oesophageal diverticulectomy using linear stapler is easier by this approach and reduces the chance of stricture formation . it also is well suited for performance of long oesophageal myotomy and an abdominal antireflux procedure . the technical difficulty encountered is during dissection of diverticulum from the adherent pleura and instrument triangulation in a confined space . an extrapolation of this technique is performance of laparoscopic transhiatal diveticulectomy through the single incision approach . single incision laparoscopy has already emerged as a strong contender for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery in terms of providing virtually scarless surgery . it is more comfortable for experienced laparoscopic surgeons since it makes use of existing laparoscopic instruments and technology with few modifications in the operating technique . though many procedures ranging from basic to advanced have been successfully done using single incision laparoscopy , none so far have described the application of this technique for transhiatal oesophageal diverticulectomy . the advantages are the superior cosmesis , elimination of complications related to multiport technique such as port site hernia , bleeding and nerve injury . since the hiatus is nearly a midline structure , multiple ports placed through a transumblical incision allow direct access for dissection and manipulation . liver retraction is done using many innovative techniques such as corrugated drain through which a double armed silk suture onstraight needle has been passed and brought out through liver substance and the anterior abdominal wall . instrument triangulation is achieved by raising skin flaps and placing ports at over a wider area . making use of long instruments keeps the instrument handles in different planes and avoids clashes outside the abdomen . we also make use of the endoeye scope ( olympus , america ) which has integrated light and camera cable with chip on stick technology thus requiring less space and making it easier for the camera operator to manipulate the instrument . patience and meticulous technique is required for this phase of dissection to avoid pleural injury . since diverticulectomy alone has been associated with increased rate of recurrences and suture line leaks , a long myotomy is performed anteriorly extending proximally from above the diverticular neck to distally 2 cm below the ge junction . an antireflux procedure was deferred in this particular case due to absence of symptoms of heartburn and objective evidence of preoperative reflux . also the oesophagus had normal peristaltic contractions and an adequate lower esophageal shincter relaxation with swallow so a fundoplication was deemed unnecessary . the patient remained symptom free during short - term follow - up of 6 months . less transhiatal oesophageal divericulectomy is possible in hands of expert laparoscopic surgeons without compromising the safety of the procedure .\",\n",

specific factors such as lipid amount or composition.5 typically , adult patients with if who develop liver dysfunction present with mild cholestasis or steatosis . ifald remains a primary indication for small bowel transplantation.6 if recognised early and managed appropriately , ifald is treatable and potentially reversible . here , we describe the multifactorial nature of ifald and the normalisation of liver function tests in an adult patient with if following multidisciplinary treatment , including optimisation of non - nutrient and nutrient - related factors . a 25-year old man , diagnosed in 2003 with crohn 's disease , was referred to our if unit following repeated small bowel resections , complicated by intra - abdominal sepsis and enterocutaneous fistulae . his final surgery in 2007 left him with 40  cm small bowel from the duodeno  jejunal flexure to a loop jejunostomy and 180  cm distal small bowel in continuity with the colon ( figure 1 ) . he was established on a pn regimen of five nights with 4  l glucose bags and two nights with 2  l 20% intralipid bags , each with 2400  kcal and 13.5  g nitrogen and appropriate electrolytes , vitamins and trace elements . a diagram of the patient 's intestinal anatomy ( left ) was drawn from barium follow - though imaging ( right ) and surgical notes from extensive bowel surgery with complications . cross - sectional imaging revealed multiple small bowel strictures distally to the loop jejunostomy ( figure 1 ) . in order to reduce pn dependency , after 3  months follow - up , abnormal liver function tests led to termination of methotrexate and change of his hpn formulation from intralipid to clinoliec 20% , containing 80% refined olive oil and 20% soybean oil . during the following years , he was reviewed at his local hospital since he remained reluctant to further assessment for enteral nutrition or reconstructive surgery at our centre . in february 2012 , the patient presented with a fungal catheter infection and abnormal liver function tests and was readmitted . on admission , bilirubin was 96  mol / l , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) 161  iu / l and alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) 300  amphotericin b was given , and because line salvage in fungal line sepsis is rarely  if ever  tests for viral and autoimmune hepatitis and cross - sectional imaging including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were normal except for liver steatosis . following central catheter removal and antifungal therapy , the patient was switched from clinoleic to smof lipid 20% , a mixture of soybean ( 30% ) , medium - chain triglycerides ( 30% ) , olive oil ( 25% ) and fish oils ( 15% ) . with these multifactorial interventions , his course was complicated by cryptogenic guillain barr syndrome ( gbs ) requiring immunoglobulin treatment with a subsequent rise in alt and bilirubin , the latter peaking above 200 mol / l . following recovery , distal end tube feeding ( detf ) was introduced and gradually built up to 1800  ml vital 1.5 ( 2700  kcal and 125  g protein ) given over 18  h , with 30  ml saline flushes pre and post feed . after a gradual increase in flow rate , the patient ultimately managed an infusion rate of 100  ml / h over 10  h , allowing a decrease in his pn demands to 750  kcal with 9  g nitrogen in glucose bags only , with additional electrolytes to replace the fluid losses from his high - output proximal stoma . levels of conjugated bilirubin , alt and alp normalised and remained within the normal ranges . the patient gradually improved and was discharged on combined detf and hpn . for immunosuppression , azathioprine was given via the distal limb , with concomitant thiopurine metabolite monitoring to verify absorption . when fully recovered from gbs , he will undergo reconstructive surgery in order to restore intestinal continuity . the multidisciplinary treatment of ifald targets both non - nutrient and nutrient - related factors ( figure 2 ) . when treated proactively , ifald is potentially reversible . important diagnostic investigations and non - nutrient and nutrient related causal factors implicated in intestinal failure - associated liver disease ( ifald ) . sepsis : the relation between sepsis and jaundice is well known.8 in patients with hpn , sepsis may explain up to half of the episodes of abnormal liver function tests.5 because patients with hpn with relapsing sepsis frequently develop cholestasis , sepsis prevention and prompt management remain pivotal . in if , sepsis is most often caused by catheter - related blood stream infections , and securing central catheter integrity is essential . strict adherence to catheter care protocols , management by specialist nutrition teams , and maximal sterile barrier precautions all reduce the risk of catheter -

       " {'article': 'shallow subretinal fluid may persist after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery , even though the retina may appear fully attached on ophthalmoscopy . robertson1 described subretinal precipitates after delayed absorption of shallow subretinal fluid following scleral buckling procedures . recently , optical coherence tomography ( oct ) has been used to document persistent subretinal fluid after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery . oct images show shallow remnants of subretinal fluid despite resolution of all retinal breaks and a fully attached retina on ophthalmoscopy.2 in a recent study , ricker et al3 found persistent subretinal fluid in 94% of cases at one month postoperatively . persistent subretinal fluid may decrease visual recovery , causing poor central vision , metamorphopsia , and loss of depth perception . however , the effect on the final outcome remains unclear.25 there are several possible causes for persistent subretinal fluid , but there is little conclusive evidence for either vitrectomy versus buckling surgery , cryotherapy , use of tamponade , or complete drainage of subretinal fluid . studies of various case series using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy show increased cellularity in the photoreceptor outer segment ( fragments ) in the shallow subretinal fluid from patients with longstanding rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and persistent subretinal fluid on oct postoperatively . here we present a case of accumulation of thick residual shallow subretinal fluid , after retinal surgery for acute rhegmatogenous retinal detachment , sparing the fovea . a 28-year - old male presented with acute visual loss in the right eye of four days duration . the patient had undergone bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis for myopia ( 6 d ) 11 months prior to presentation . clinical examination revealed that visual acuity was 20/40 od and fundus examination showed an acute bulbous rhegmatogenous retinal detachment sparing the fovea that was caused by a large horseshoe tear located in the supratemporal quadrant of the fundus at the equator . the patient underwent an uneventful 20 gauge pars plana vitrectomy with perfluoropropane / air exchange ( 15% perfluoropropane gas injection ) , endolaser for the causative break , and an encircling silicone band scleral buckle ( size 240 ) . the patient was asked to remain recumbent on his left side for two weeks postoperatively . a detailed fundus examination was obtained four weeks postoperatively when the gas had completely resolved ; visual acuity at this time was 20/40 , but the patient complained of blurry vision . on fundus examination , the retina was fat with multiple yellowish subretinal deposits resembling vitelliform lesions in the macula and outside the retinal arcade . some of the lesions were encroaching the fovea and were connected by a tract to the area of the previous horseshoe tear , with evidence of a shallow layer of thick , yellowish subretinal fluid ( figure 1 ) . oct showed shallow subretinal fluid with hyper - reflective material corresponding to the pseudovitelliform lesions sequestered between the retinal pigment epithelium and neurosensory layer ( figure 2 ) . the patient was followed up frequently over one year postoperatively and his symptoms persist to date , with visual acuity remaining at 20/40 . fundus examination consistently showed a fat retina with retinal pigment epithelium mottling , and faint scars corresponding to previous lesions ( figure 3 ) . oct showed complete resolution of shallow subretinal fluid , and the subretinal deposit ( figure 4 ) . fluorescein angiography showed a window defect and late staining , corresponding to the area of retinal pigment epithelium mottling , with faint scarring . both research5,6 and clinical practice demonstrate that fluid absorption is favored by strong forces , including oncotic pressure gradients , hydrostatic pressure , and an active retinal pigment epithelial pump . in many cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment , fluid absorption proceeds very rapidly when the retinal breaks are closed , even without drainage of fluid , as in pneumatic retinopexy . however , it is still unclear why small fluid remnants take months to resorb in certain cases . in new detachments , an oncotic pressure gradient and an active retinal pigment epithelial pump favor rapid fluid absorption when all retinal breaks are closed.7 negi and marmor6 demonstrated that breakdown of the blood  retinal barrier , caused by damage to the retinal pigment epithelium , facilitates absorption of the shallow subretinal fluid due to the greater oncotic pressure in the choroid . nonsyneretic vitreous may slow the progression of retinal detachment by tamponading retinal breaks , and may be an important factor in the persistence of shallow subretinal fluid after retinal reattachment . the high viscosity of shallow subretinal fluid may cause it to stick to the retinal pigment epithelium when it is drained . also , higher hyaluronic acid levels in the vitreous , and consequently in the shallow subretinal fluid , would slow fluid absorption . it is well known that hyaluronic acid is the preferred substance for experimental retinal detachment , because it maintains the detachment over long periods of time , possibly by inhibiting phagocytic activity in the retinal pigment epithelium.8 further , in longstanding detachments , the higher oncotic pressure of the fluid remnants may act against fluid absorption . the oncotic pressure of the shallow subretinal fluid increases with duration of detachment.9 although the majority of studies do report that persistent fluid may slow visual recovery , with resolution of fluid usually coinciding with improved visual acuity , the final outcome may not be affected.25 however , patients suffering from persistent foveal detachment may have significant complaints about poor central vision . metamorphopsia and loss of depth perception can persist for over a year after  successful  retinal detachment surgery , and further damage to the retinal pigment epithelium is quite possible when fluid persists under the macula . in experimental detachments using hyaluronic acid , photoreceptor apoptosis is observed within weeks.10 irreversible retinal pigment epithelium damage could occur sooner in cases of persistent shallow subretinal fluid after retinal detachment . our case had a very recent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and there were no signs that it was chronic , such as subretinal precipitate . it is possible that residual shallow subretinal fluid was responsible for formation of the subretinal vitelliform material , because we drained the shallow subretinal fluid through the original break , and it is quite likely that some shallow subretinal fluid remained trapped between the break and the posterior pole at the end of the gas / air exchange procedure . presumably , the shallow subretinal fluid was more conspicuous in this patient with bullous rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . subsequently , the patient developed a residual thick subretinal deposit after absorption of the shallow subretinal fluid , which was demonstrated clinically , as well as on oct and fluorescein angiography . this material was most likely lipofuscin , generated from damage to the outer segments of the photoreceptors , and as these materials faded , they resulted in retinal pigment epithelium mottling with faint scarring . we believe that this is a rare presentation with unusual sequelae after management of acute rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . persistent subretinal fluid with thick composition does occur even after successful surgery for acute retinal detachment sparing the fovea and can cause visual dysfunction .',\n",

among 255 aneurysms in 191 patients , complete occlusion rates of 91.2% and 95.2% were achieved at six and 24 months , respectively , with a permanent morbidity rate of 1% and mortality rate of 0.5% . of these , 11.8% were giant aneurysms , and at six months of follow up , 90% of aneurysms were completely occluded . although use of the ped has been limited in korea , several studies have reported unfavorable complications . the rate of minor events was 9~16.7% and mortality was 0~6.4%.5)9)13)15)16)17)22)26)28 ) on systematic review , stroke due to thromboembolism was 3.2% and that of in stent stenosis more than 50% was 3.5%.19 ) the perforator occlusion , which is a main concern related to the ped , was reported as 2.5% by multiple applied devices , improper deployment , and resistance to antiplatelet medication.15)20)26)28 ) in addition , mcauliffe et al.17 ) experienced two cases of ped migration through the initial learning curve . after treatment with ped , intracranial hemorrhage of 0~6% was reported and possible causes were aneurysm rupture during the procedure , hemorrhagic transformation from ischemic tissue , inflammation of aneurysm wall , and foreign body 's reaction.5)10)20)22)26 ) in our experience using the ped for treatment of two giant intracranial aneurysms , the device flexibility was satisfactory with good stability . in both cases , the device was successfully apposed to the parent vessel wall without difficulty using standard microcatheters . follow - up results confirmed that the ped affects the amount of blood flow into the sac and induces thrombosis in the sac . treatment of giant aneurysms using open surgical or conventional endovascular methods is often risky and challenging . based on our experience of using the ped , we suggest that it could be another modality for treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'fever is a frequent complication of stroke and is associated with worsened prognosis.1,2 fever is likewise generally associated with infection because stroke patients are susceptible to various complications , such as aspiration pneumonia , urinary tract infection , or atelectasis.3,4 most fevers that occur with stroke are caused by infections . fevers without documented infection ( probably that of central origin or  central hyperthermia  ) were determined in 33% of stroke patients in a prospective study.5 fevers from a central origin and those caused by infection have completely different treatment strategies , and thus proper identification is important . central hyperthermia is characterized by a rapid onset , high temperature , marked temperature fluctuation , and higher mortality.5,6 intracerebral hemorrhage , especially in the brainstem , is more predisposed in central fevers than in cerebral infarction . most stroke patients with central fever had an increased temperature of 39c within 1 day.7 however , central fever is not persistent , and abated within 96 hours in 90% of stroke patients . central fever rarely occurs during the subacute stage of stroke.7 antipyretics have no effect on central hyperthermia.8 in this paper , we present a case of a patient who suffered from prolonged central fever after an intracranial hemorrhage that involved cerebellar , putaminal , and brainstem hemorrhagic stroke . the fever was difficult to control until bromocriptine was administered . he did not have a past history of autoimmune disease or hepatitis , nor of recent travel . the patient was sent to the nearest emergency department of a community hospital because of dizziness and nausea with occasional vomiting . he was noted to be initially alert , but then his mental status rapidly declined . the patient underwent rapid sequence intubation , and was transferred to the emergency department of the medical center . his blood pressure was 170/117 mmhg . left pupil dilatation ( 6 mm ) without light reflex was noted . the head computed tomography scan showed a large acute hematoma in the left cerebellum ( 48 mm  46 mm ) ruptured into the fourth ventricle , which caused an intraventricular hemorrhage , and another acute hematoma in the pons and midbrain ( 20 mm  20 mm ) ( figure 1a ) . consciousness improvement was noted using the glasgow coma scale from e1vtm1 to e4vtm5 ; however , intermittent fever had also been noted since his admission ( figure 2 ) . temperature was characterized by a spike fever with marked fluctuations ranging from 37c to 41c . the neurosurgeon prescribed unasyn ( ampicillin and sulbactam ; pfizer , inc , new york , ny , usa ) empirically for 2 weeks . the antibiotics were changed to tazocin ( piperacillin and tazobactam ; pfizer , inc ) because pseudomonas was found in one set of the sputum culture . the antibiotics were then changed to tienam ( imipenem and cilastatin ; merck and co , inc , whitehouse station , nj , usa ) because the intermittent high fever remained . the fever persisted despite the full course of antibiotic treatment and normal white blood cell count , c - reactive protein , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , and negative blood cultures . the autoimmune profile blood test , including tests for antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors , were negative . tumor markers , including carcinoembryonic antigen , alpha - fetoprotein , and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 , were likewise negative . given the long - term use of antibiotics , we checked the stool toxin for clostridium difficile and obtained a positive result . however , the fever with marked temperature fluctuations and poor response to antipyretics was still noted . an inflammation scan was arranged to determine any infection or inflammation , which may have been the cause of the fluctuating high fever . physical cooling , including sponging , using a wet towel , and removing clothing , were employed to reduce the temperature , but hyperthermia reoccurred when the physical cooling procedure ceased . under the impression of central hyperthermia , bromocriptine 2.5 mg / day was prescribed for 3 days and then increased to 5 mg / day . in the following week another week later , the body temperature baseline was reduced to 37c , and low - grade fever with minor temperature fluctuations occurred only occasionally ( figure 2 ) . the patient was discharged to the nursing home , and a follow - up 1 month later revealed no occurrence of fever . table 1 shows the fever pattern , impression / diagnosis , and management during the clinical course . after solving the fever problem , improved endurance and motivation were noted , and the patient was able to undergo more aggressive rehabilitation programs . fever occurs in 23% of stroke patients , and a third of these were documented without infection.5 central hyperthermia remains as an exclusion diagnosis . in these cases , thus , not every febrile patient without documented infection has central hyperthermia . either the locations of stroke ( supratentorial or infratentorial ) and types of stroke ( hemorrhagic or ischemic ) may cause an elevation in body temperature on the first day of stroke.9,10 although poststroke central hyperthermia is common , prolonged cases are rare . central hyperthermia exceeding 39c abated within 4 days for approximately 90% of patients.7 differentiating central hyperthermia from an infection with fever is important because their treatments completely differ . in the present case , the diagnosis of central hyperthermia was delayed for several weeks , and the long - term use of antibiotics led to pseudomembranous colitis . such a result was previously reported.11 hyperthermia is detrimental to the recovery of an injured brain , and the duration of fever is associated with poor outcome.6,12 therefore , the timely and accurate diagnosis of central hyperthermia is crucial and could prevent unnecessary antibiotic use . the characteristics of central hyperthermia include a rapid onset ( 76% of patients developed a fever of 39c within 12 hours after the stroke ) , high temperature , marked temperature fluctuation , and poor response to antipyretics and antibiotics . pharmacological management of prolonged central hyperthermia is difficult to study due to high mortality and poor prognosis . baclofen was successfully used to abolish the prolonged central hyperthermia in a case report.13 however , baclofen has side effects such as drowsiness , tiredness , and muscle weakness on the affected or unaffected limbs.14 these side effects may interfere with the rehabilitation program . some medications have been reported to lower the body temperature after a traumatic brain injury by regulating the sympathetic activity.15 in another case report , a patient with traumatic brain injury and high fever of 40.5c without documented infection received bromocriptine ( 0.025 mg / kg twice daily and gradually increased to 0.05 mg / kg thrice daily ) . a comparison of the mean daily temperatures before and after the bromocriptine prescription revealed the significant lowering of body temperature ( p = 0.003 ) . the patient was slowly weaned from bromocriptine over the next 5 weeks.16 bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and acts at the level of the hypothalamus and corpus striatum.17 the hypothalamus regulates central autonomic activity and has numerous connections with other parts of the central nervous system.18 hypothalamus dysfunction could lead to wide fluctuations in the core body temperature,19 and therefore bromocriptine could also be used to control central hyperthermia.16,17 stroke could be associated with autonomic dysfunction , and hemorrhagic stroke is more common than ischemic stroke.20,21 based on these reports , we selected bromocriptine to treat prolonged central hyperthermia without the side effects of baclofen , such as general weakness and lethargy . central hyperthermia should be considered as a possible diagnosis for a stroke patient with fever to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use .',\n",

we need to rely on clinical suspicion . the authors observed that the best surgical outcome for these young women would be to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy and detorsion of the ovarian pedicle as early as possible to prevent further ischemic injury to the ovary and tube , which otherwise may have a devastating effect on the future reproductive performance . \\n  a 14-year - old presented with history of acute pain abdomen , pointing to the right iliac fossa , which was intermittent and colicky in nature and radiating to the thighs . she was unable to ambulate and had five to six episodes of vomiting and giddiness . she had attained menarche 5 months back , and was having regular cycles with spasmodic dysmenorrhea . , she had adequate age - related physical and secondary sexual characters . on abdominal palpation , a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the possibility of adnexal torsion was high on our mind as she was menstruating . the leading point of torsion , about two to three turns , was seen close to the right cornua [ figure 2 ] . after confirming the diagnosis of adnexal torsion and ruling out appendicitis , detorsion of the ovarian pedicle was performed . release of the constriction ring formed on the ovarian pedicle and the meso - salphinx was performed . within 15 min , the constriction ring disappeared and normal pulsations in the ovarian pedicle could be visualized . also , the deeply blue and congested ovary and tube regained their color and contour , although with areas of hemorrhage on the ovary [ figures 3a and b ] . the tube and ovary did not show evidence of any gross pathology , reconfirming the fact it was a spontaneous adnexal torsion of the normal adnexa , probably due to increased vascularity during menstruation [ figure 4 ] . oophoropexy was not performed as the tissues were friable and the reproductive outcome of such a procedure has not been documented in the literature . she is on follow - up for 4 years , with normal cycles except for spasmodic dysmenorrhea , which responds to spasmolytics , and with no clinical evidence of recurrence . panoramic view of normal left tube ( t ) and ovary ( o ) . congested and swollen right tube ( ct ) and ovary ( co ) . u : uterus , b : bowel t - apex of torsion of the ovarian pedicle and mesosalphinx , ipl - infundibulopelvic ligament with the ovarian vessels , co : congested ovary , ct : congested tube , u : uterus , b : bowel , h : haemorrhagic fluid in pouch of douglas . eia : external iliac artery , p : psoas muscle d - ipl : detorted infundibulopelvic ligament depicting the constriction ring due to torsion , b : bowel , co : congested ovary r : constriction ring on the fallopian tube , co : congested ovary , b : bowel , ft : fallopian tube o : decongested ovary with areas of resolving haemorrhages and ft : normal looking fallopian tube the differential diagnosis for acute pain abdomen , colicky in nature , with rebound tenderness in an adolescent in the peripubertal age group includes acute appendicitis , right ovarian cyst with torsion or intracystic bleeding and corpus luteum cyst rupture , ectopic pregnancy , adnexal torsion or isolated tubal torsion . because the pain was in the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness suggesting local peritonitis and inflammation , and there was a raised total count with leucocytosis , acute appendicitis was first considered . ectopic pregnancy was ruled out , as there was no history of abuse or sexual exposure and the urine pregnancy test was negative . clinical features of right ovarian cyst , corpus luteum cyst , or an adnexal component with hemorrhage and/or torsion , presenting as intermittent colicky pain , fever and leucocytosis , low haemoglobin due the internal bleed or rupture of the cyst around the peri menstrual period can be confounding and overlapping and hence the differential diagnosis can be broad . adnexal torsion being an uncommon cause for acute pain abdomen needs a high degree of clinical suspicion , which can change the management outcome , and should be considered in all young women with acute pain abdomen . was not performed to save time , a diagnostic laparoscopy and detorsion of the ovarian pedicle and the mesosalphix was executed . the macroscopic appearance of the ovary was not a reliable indicator of the degree of necrosis and potential for ovarian recovery ; therefore , it is worth the wait for change in color following detorsion . within 15 min , the adnexal structures regained normal color and contour ; , oophoropexy was not performed as the tissues were very friable and the reproductive outcomes of such a procedure were not known . spontaneous torsion of the ovarian pedicle with an anatomically normal tube and ovary presenting as an acute abdomen in a post - menarcheal adolescent reported in the present study is a very rare clinical entity . this may be the first case to date being published in the english medical literature . hence , it has to be considered in the differential diagnosis . by avoiding non - specific , time - consuming diagnostic work - up , we strongly recommend diagnostic laparoscopy and detorsion of the ovarian pedicle and mesosalphinx to prevent further catastrophic consequences and preserve fertility in these young women . the time factor from the diagnosis to intervention plays a critical role in salvaging the reproductive functions .',\n",

to - soft tissue opacities were noted in the fourth rib costochondral junction and at the ventral aspect of the seventh intercostal space ( black arrows ) four days after the cat was initially presented , the owners reported that she was eating well and was more active . examination of both eyes revealed no change from the findings noted on the first day on which the cat was presented . the owners were advised of the possibility that primary or metastatic neoplasia or an infectious agent was the likely cause of the blindness and pulmonary mass , and referral for consultation with an ophthalmologist and a neurologist was recommended . nine days after the cat was initially presented , the owners reported that her appetite and activity continued to improve . both pupils were dilated and direct plr and menace response were absent in both eyes . fourteen days after the initial presentation , the cat was evaluated by a neurologist and underwent mri which revealed normal brain parenchyma and ventricular system , and a slightly enlarged pituitary gland . ophthalmic examination 17 days after the initial presentation confirmed blindness and dilated non - responsive pupils in both eyes ( ou ) . the tapetal fundus of the left eye had a homogenous tan appearance with an infiltrate that almost completely obscured the tapetum and variably obscured the retinal vessels resulting in apparent absence or thinning of many retinal vessels , and a beaded appearance to others ( figure 3 ) . in the right eye there was nearly complete bullous retinal detachment ( figure 4 ) . applanation tonometry ( reichert tono pen xl ; medtronic ) estimated the iop as 16 mmhg od and 12 mmhg os . aspiration of the lung mass and vitreous was recommended due to suspicion of metastatic neoplasia or systemic infection . a diffuse tan subretinal and/or intraretinal infiltrate almost completely obscured the tapetum and many retinal blood vessels causing them to be inapparent , inconsistently thinned and sometimes to appear beaded ( arrow ) . note the bullous detachment of all but the dorsolateral retina , and retinal hemorrhages located adjacent to the optic nerve , alongside retinal vessels and in the dorsolateral peripheral fundus twenty - two days after the cat was initially presented the owner reported that her appetite had decreased again but activity was improving . on physical examination , the cat had lost approximately 15% of its body weight ( 3.2 kg ) and was now estimated to have a body condition score of 2/5 . the heart rate and respiration rate were 200 beats / min and 40 breaths / min , respectively , and both heart and lungs auscultated normally . abdominal radiographs confirmed left renomegaly ( figure 5 ) , and on thoracic radiographs the mass in the dorsal aspect of the left caudal lung lobe remained the same and had not increased in size . cbc results included mature neutrophilia ( 24,752/l ; ri 25008500/l ) and mild monocytosis ( 816/l ; ri600/l ) . serum chemistry profile findings included hypercalcemia ( 13.0 mg / dl ; ri 8.210.8 mg / dl ) , increased amylase ( 2232 u / l ; ri 1001200 ( a ) ventrodorsal and ( b ) lateral radiographic views of the abdomen taken on day 22 following initial presentation . the mass in the dorsal aspect of the left caudal lung lobe remained the same and had not increased in size due to lack of evidence supporting an infectious etiology , the results obtained on the initial fine - needle aspiration of the pulmonary mass , and the strong suspicion of a neoplasm , it was decided to perform vitreocentesis , ultrasound - guided aspiration of the left kidney and repeat the aspiration of the pulmonary mass . ophthalmic examination of the right eye immediately prior to vitreocentesis revealed normal periocular skin , eyelids , third eyelid and sclera . there was evidence of anterior uveitis with mild conjunctival injection , keratic precipitates ventrally , fibrin on the anterior lens capsule and thickened iris along with moderate rubeosis iridis . vitreocentesis was performed od as that eye had more advanced disease and was irreversibly blind . vitreocentesis was performed 5 mm posterior to the dorsomedial limbus aspirating cellular material under direct observation through the dilated pupil . cytological evaluation of the aspirated right vitreous revealed a malignant epithelial neoplasm with moderate histiocytic and neutrophilic inflammation . cytological evaluation of the aspirated samples taken from the left kidney and pulmonary mass revealed atypical epithelial cells suggestive of carcinoma , mixed inflammation , necrosis , and recent and chronic hemorrhage . the cat was euthanized 28 days after she was initially presented , due to poor prognosis . on post - mortem examination , on cut sections , both kidneys had an irregular corticomedullary junction , with multifocal , poorly demarcated tan masses expanding the cortex ( figure 6 ) . the largest mass was in the left kidney and measured 1  1  0.4 mm . in the right kidney a wedge - shaped red area adjacent to a tan mass was suggestive of an infarct . in the left caudal lung lobe , a firm , tan , cavitated mass ( 2 cm diameter ) was identified , and smaller masses were scattered throughout the other lung lobes . in the brain , a 4 mm diameter depressed area was located on the ventral aspect of the left temporal lobe . the aqueous humor of both eyes was cloudy and red tinged , partly owing to post - mortem changes , but disease progression was also possible ( figure 7 ) . finally , examination of the muscles revealed a firm , tan , poorly demarcated , cavitated mass in the skeletal muscle of the right caudal thigh . the aqueous humor was bilaterally cloudy . in the left eye , the iris was pale tan and thickened ( arrow ) . bar = 1 cm on histologic examination , the pelvis of the kidneys was lined with polygonal neoplastic cells which multifocally invaded the submucosa to form islands and acinar structures ( figure 8) . the neoplastic cells demonstrated moderate anisocytosis and anisokaryosis and had moderate amounts of granular , often vacuolated , eosinophilic cytoplasm , round - to - oval nuclei with finally stippled chromatin , and 13 magenta nucleoli . nodules of similar cells multifocally expanded the renal parenchyma and were surrounded by proliferative spindle cells ( scirrhous response ) . bilaterally , the renal capsule was severely expanded by fibrous connective tissue infiltrated by neutrophils , macrophages and lymphocytes . the left optic nerve , perineurium and uveal tract were multifocally infiltrated by clusters of neoplastic cells similar to those in the kidney , consistent with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma . these cells lined the anterior and posterior face of the iris , and the vitreous chamber where they replaced the retina ( figure 9 ) . changes in the right eye included a neoplastic infiltrate in the choroid and ciliary body and diffuse retinal detachment , and atrophy . masses in the lungs , thigh muscle and cerebral cortex were composed of neoplastic cells similar to those described in the kidney . the neoplastic population in the left eye showed moderate immunoreactivity to ck7 ( figure 10 ) . the renal pelvis was lined by proliferative neoplastic cells forming irregular plaques ( arrowheads ) and papillary structures ( arrows ) that were multifocally invading the submucosa . the anterior ( arrowhead ) and posterior surfaces ( arrow ) of the iris were lined by neoplastic cells forming plaques and small papillary structures that multifocally invaded the underlying tissue . renal tcc occurs as a result of neoplastic changes to the transitional epithelial layer that lines the pelvis of the kidney . feline renal tcc has been reported in several case studies . in two case series , feline renal tcc was found to affect nearly 16% and 42% , respectively , of cats evaluated for primary renal tumors ( excluding lymphoma ) . other reported primary renal neoplasms in cats include renal cell carcinoma , nephroblastoma , squamous cell carcinoma , tubulopapillary carcinoma , hemangiosarcoma , tubular carcinoma and adenomas , with lymphoma being the most common tumor affecting the feline kidney . the age of cats affected by renal tcc ranges from 415 years , with an average of 11.8 years . of the 14 cats reported to have renal tcc four were neutered males , three were spayed females and no sex was reported for the additional eight cases . owing to the small number of cases reported it is difficult to determine if there is a statistically significant breed predisposition or sex predilection in cats . the clinical signs associated with renal tcc and other primary renal tumors are often non - specific and not directly associated with the renal system . the most commonly reported clinical signs are anorexia , weight loss , depression and lethargy . it is possible that by the time owners seek medical attention the tumor has already metastasized or has elaborated enough inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha , interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 , which promote anorexia , increased energy metabolism and accelerated loss of lean body mass . cbc and serum chemistry profile do not show specific changes associated with primary renal neoplasia . henry et al found that of 10 cats with serum chemistry profile results available , eight cats demonstrated azotemia ; carpenter et al found that azotemia was present only when the unaffected kidney had severe , chronic inflammation . as renal tcc tends to affect older cats it is possible that the presence of azotemia is associated with chronic renal disease . a causative relationship between chronic renal disease and renal tcc in cats has been proposed but not established . the urine specific gravity of cats with renal tcc and other primary renal neoplasia has been reported to range from 1.0101.042 . hematuria was found in 6/9 cases , and might be a useful indicator of renal neoplasia , once other causes of hematuria are excluded . in the cat of the present report , non - specific clinical signs were first thought to be associated with gastrointestinal - related disease such as pancreatitis , inflammatory bowel disease or cholangiohepatitis . renal neoplasia was suspected only after renomegaly was noted later in the course of the disease . renal tcc in cats has a unilateral presentation in most cases , unlike renal lymphoma , which tends to be mostly bilateral . unilateral involvement was noted in 85.7% of cases of feline renal tcc reviewed , while one case of renal tcc originated in the left kidney and metastasized to the right kidney . there has been only one report in cats of bilateral de novo renal tcc and the diagnosis was supported by the absence of renal vascular invasion and lack of distant metastasis . in the cat of the present report , the pelvis of both kidneys was affected ; however , as metastasis was evident and vascular invasion was noted , it is difficult to determine from which kidney the tumor originated or if it was a bilateral independent neoplasm . on gross pathologic examination , kidneys affected by tcc may be firm and slightly enlarged or irregularly shaped . however , minimal or no gross changes can result in normal palpation and ultrasonographic findings , as in this case and one previously reported case . renal tcc seems to be especially aggressive in cats and dogs and has been documented to metastasize to multiple sites , including lungs , ureter , liver , mesentery , peritoneum , meninges , perirenal soft tissue , adrenals , lymph nodes , skeletal muscles , spleen , pleura and the heart . several tumor types have been shown to metastasize to the eyes of cats and dogs ; for example , lymphoma , carcinomas , transmissible venereal tumor and hemangiosarcoma . only 2/75 ( 2.6% ) feline eyes with intraocular neoplasia yielded a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma . in people , the occurrence of intraocular metastasis has been documented to range from 4.28.5% of patients with cancer , depending on the origin of the carcinoma . breast and lung carcinomas were found to be the leading causes of uveal metastasis and represent more than two - thirds of the primary tumor sites found in people . infiltration of neoplastic cells occurs through the short and long posterior ciliary arteries and , to a lesser extent , through the anterior ciliary arteries . in people , there are isolated case reports of tcc originating in the bladder , urethra and ovary with orbital and intraocular metastasis in human beings , dogs and a collared peccary . intraocular metastasis of tcc originating in the kidneys has been reported only once in people , and to the best of our knowledge the current case is the first reported renal tcc with ocular metastasis in cats . it is possible that ocular abnormalities manifested before the renal abnormalities in the cat of the present report because tcc tends to grow along surfaces . as it did so over the choroid , retina and renal pelvices , blindness due to loss of retinal function may have been more obvious to the owners than loss of kidney function . immunohistochemistry using antibodies to ck7 and ck20 can help characterize urothelial tumors and assist in distinguishing them from other types of carcinomas . of four reported feline tcc tumors , three were positive for ck7 and ck20 , and one was negative for both antibodies . in the cat of the present case , both the primary renal tumor and the ocular metastases showed moderate - to - strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to ck7 and the ocular metastases showed negative immunoreactivity to ck20 . examination of more feline tcc tumors with immunohistochemistry to ck7 and ck20 is required to determine the most common pattern of immunoreactivity . the prognosis for renal tcc is poor and tumors often have metastasized by the time of diagnosis . nephrectomy of the affected kidney can be considered if there is no evidence of metastasis and if the other kidney is determined to be functional . analysis of the medical management of the case in this report provides an opportunity to explore the decision - making process in veterinary medicine . clinical decision making is a cognitive process that occurs in both the conscious and subconscious levels . briefly , system 1 is largely intuitive and allows clinicians to identify a disease based on a familiar pattern ( pattern recognition ) . system 1 requires less mental energy and operates fast but is more prone to mistakes owing to different cognitive biases , heuristics (  rules of thumb ) and affective states . system 2 , however , is more analytical and problem - oriented , operating more slowly and deliberately , requiring more time and mental effort . different strategies have been recommended to minimize cognitive error that originates in cognitive biases afflicting the decision making process , particularly in system 1 . metacognition , applications of checklists , diagnostic algorithms and slowing down while going through the diagnostic process are a few of the recommended strategies . the reported clinical signs of inappetence and lethargy in conjunction with the young age of the cat in the present report were intuitively thought of as gastrointestinal in origin . in the present case , system 1  which was influenced by different cognitive biases such as confirmation bias , anchoring bias and over - confidence bias , in addition to familiarity / recognition heuristics  led to focusing on the inappetence and lethargy , giving them greater emphasis in the diagnostic plan and not recognizing that the blindness found on the physical examination was a key element in reaching a more accurate diagnosis . in the present case , the blindness should have been addressed much earlier than it was with a referral to an ophthalmologist . in addition , performing an ocular ultrasound at the same time of the abdominal ultrasound could have provided useful information regarding the ocular fundus , potentially detecting retinal detachment and/or choridial thickening which would have localized the disease process to the eye and not to the brain . as a result of confirmation bias , the tests that were initially ordered intended mainly to confirm a gastrointestinal related diagnosis . if thoracic radiographs were taken before more specialized tests were pursued the differential diagnosis would have expended earlier in the diagnostic process and the cat could have been managed differently and more humanely , avoiding unnecessary imaging tests , laboratory tests and medications , and at a more reasonable cost to the owners . a more active and trained system 2 in addition to metacognition would have provided more safeguards against cognitive biases and could have decreased the likelihood of cognitive error . in spite of the rare occurrence of renal tcc , clinicians should consider the condition , especially in older cats presenting with anorexia , weight loss , depression and lethargy . all patients presented for blindness and mydriasis or noted to have ocular signs during a general physical examination should undergo a complete ophthalmic examination before expensive and higher risk procedures are performed . clinicians should familiarize themselves with the intricate cognitive process and cognitive biases that take place during diagnosis and management of patients . metacognition and other cognitive forcing strategies should be learned and incorporated into the diagnostic process to safeguard and decrease the chances of cognitive error and increase the chances of accurate and timely diagnosis .',\n",

obstetric nf.47 various microbial agents have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of nf , with existent literature reporting a variety of gram - positive and gram - negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms.8,9 the scenario in the obstetric population is further complicated by associated comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus , malnutrition , anemia , and intravenous substance abuse.4,5 of these comorbidities , undernourishment and anemia are highly prevalent in developing countries . the association of undernourishment in pregnant women with nf and its impact on the prognosis of nf has not been discussed adequately in the obstetric literature . prompt correction of nutritional status improves the survival rates in these patients.10 our study aims to highlight the risk of nf in undernourished and anemic women during the postpartum period following operative intervention . rapid correction of severe undernourishment and anemia by total parenteral nutrition and blood transfusion is vital for successful management . an undernourished and anemic woman of 26 years old , gravida 3 para 2 , presented to our hospital on the eighth postpartum day with extensive ulceration on the right side of the perineum following normal vaginal delivery with right mediolateral episiotomy done at a primary care center . according to the patient , she started experiencing severe excruciating pain over the episiotomy wound site from the fifth postpartum day . along with pain , she also noticed swelling and redness over the area . within the next 2 days , the skin over the area sloughed out , leaving behind a big ulcerated area over the perineum the patient also had high fever with nausea , vomiting , and passage of loose stools . at the time of admission , the patient looked pale , toxic , and dehydrated . her temperature was 39.4c ; pulse rate 120/minute ; blood pressure 90/60 mmhg ; and respiratory rate 24/minute . general health of the patient was poor , with body mass index ( bmi ) 12.8 . on local examination , an ulcer of 128 cm was seen over the right perineal area extending laterally to the inner aspect of the proximal one -

suppressed state of pregnancy may be responsible for a rapid fulminant course and high mortality.36 to further complicate the picture , women in developing countries are faced with two more comorbid conditions : undernourishment and anemia . various predisposing factors described for nf in the obstetric population are diabetes mellitus , malnutrition , and intravenous substance abuse . in our study , the diagnosis of severe undernourishment and anemia was made from very low bmi , and low serum total protein , serum albumin , and hemoglobin levels . poor nutrition and concomitant immune suppression play a crucial role by impairing the host s response to modulate the immune system and contain the infection . cellular immunity is more compromised in undernutrition and presence of devitalized tissue at the site of the wound further increases the susceptibility manifold . severely anemic patients are more prone to developing infection . in patients with severe anemia , there is alteration of the proliferation of t and b lymphocytes , which causes reduction of the bactericidal activity of the phagocytes and neutrophils , hence rapid correction of severe anemia is required . bacteriology of the infection was polymicrobial in both cases , involving klebsiella and proteus spp . broad spectrum antibiotics started on empirical basis was found to be effective as reported in sensitivity pattern subsequently . early local signs are edema , erythema , crepitus , fluctuation , and tenderness , which are nonspecific . as the disease progresses , the skin sloughs out rapidly , leaving an ulcer with undermined edges and copious discharge which may be malodorous . suspicion of nf should arise with severe pain disproportionate to these local inflammatory findings and the appearance of signs of systemic toxicity . the lrinec score was developed by wong et al11 for diagnosis of nf based on a scoring system , where scores are assigned for levels of c - reactive protein , hemoglobin , total leucocyte count , serum sodium , serum creatinine , and blood sugar . a score of 8 or more has a strong positive predictive value for diagnosing nf . the lrinec score was 9 in case 1 and 3 in case 2 . probably due to previous antibiotics and intravenous fluid administration following cesarean section , incorporation of radiological imaging , computed tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging as diagnostic tools helps in early diagnosis and determining the extent of soft - tissue infection , and thereby the subsequent limit of surgical debridement.12,13 the spread of the disease process can be delineated by the presence of gas in the area visible radiologically well before clinical assessment of the tissue.13 however , availability and cost limit the applicability of ct scans and mris . in both most physicians still have to depend upon the clinical presentation with a strong eye of suspicion and profound awareness of nf . although the key to successful management of nf is strong clinical suspicion and aggressive surgical debridement under antibiotic cover , women with undernourishment and anemia need further individualization . we successfully managed two cases of nf following episiotomy and cesarean section who presented with a double challenge of undernourishment and anemia by total parenteral nutrition and blood transfusion simultaneously . the study highlights the risk of nf in undernourished and anemic women during the postpartum period and also the importance of total parenteral nutrition and correction of the anemic state in successful management of nf . identification of risk factors for malnutrition should be part of antenatal visits , and patients with these factors should be categorized into the high - risk group . significant risk to the health of a woman can be anticipated from their dietetic history and socioeconomic background , as these factors play a crucial role in the health statuses of women from low- and middle - income countries . in addition to the routine aspects , general physical examination should consist of bmi recording and observation for signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies .',\n",

       " {'article': \"the members of the genus capillaria that have been recorded in human beings are ; capillaria hepatica , c. aerophila , and c. philippinensis . these three species cause hepatic , pulmonary , and intestinal capillariasis , respectively ( 1 , 2 ) . moreover , cases of human infection by c. philippinensis appear to be spreading geographically , and in particular , intestinal capillariasis is being increasingly reported in asia ( 3 ) . in the republic of korea , two indigenous and three imported cases of intestinal capillariasis have been reported since 1993 ( 4 , 5 ) . capillaria species parasitize various parts of the host alimentary system , mainly the small intestine and stomach , but rarely the esophagus and rectum ( 6 ) . although the stomach is an appropriate habitat for some capillaria species , no case of human stomach infection has been reported . therefore , physicians and parasitologists do not consider capillaria species as an etiologic agent of gastritis in man . on october 31 , 2006 , a 52-yr - old korean woman attended the outpatient clinic for a health checkup . she lived in jangheung - gun , jeollanam - do , a county located on the south coast . she recalled eating raw fish , i.e. , gizzard shad ( konosirus punctatus ) , purple pike conger ( muraenesox cinereus ) , and snake - head ( channa argus ) . the former two species were eaten on august 10 , 2006 and the latter during mid - august , 2005 . she had also eaten raw chicken , which she had slaughtered , at the beginning of september , 2006 . about seven years previously , she had experienced episodes of abdominal pain , and was attributed to gastritis by a local clinic . when she presented at our clinic for a health checkup , she complained of abdominal pain of approximately 3 months duration , which was accompanied sometimes by nausea , but not by vomiting , diarrhea , borborygmus , fever , or weight loss . in order to relieve this symptom , she had taken some antacids , which were obtained over - the - counter , several times a month before presentation . she also had an itching rash of one week 's duration that primarily involved a forearm . on physical examination , the blood biochemistry data was as follows : hemoglobin 13.7 g / dl , serum glucose 102 mg / dl , got 23 iu / l , -gpt 15 iu / l , and total cholesterol 189 mg / dl . stool occult blood was negative , and chest radiography findings were normal . since a parasitic infection was not considered at that time , no blood eosinophil count or stool examination for nematodes was performed . by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , the esophagus and duodenum appeared grossly normal . however , at the posterior wall of the antrum , the gastric mucosa showed an exudative flat erosive change ( fig . microscopically , the biopsied specimen disclosed mild mucosal destruction with an irregular surface and focal surface erosion . multiple sections of adult female nematodes were observed , usually in the superficial gastric mucosa . the worms lived in the epithelial layer of the glands and in adjacent tissues of the lamina propria , and had caused inflammatory cell infiltration ( fig . 3 ) . in cross sections through the uterus , female worms were 52.5 - 62.5 m ( mean 57.6 m ) in diameter . the uterus was prominent and occupied most of the pseudocoelomic cavity ( fig . 2 , 3 ) . it usually contained several eggs , which had a striated shell and inconspicuous flattened bipolar plugs ( fig . 3 , 5 ) . tangential - sectioned eggs , eggshell striations formed a network , which resembled a net with irregular meshes ( fig . based on the microscopic features of the worms and eggs , the nematodes were assigned to capillaria species . the gastric pain disappeared in two weeks , and after one year on medication the patient was healthy . a definitive diagnosis of gastrointestinal capillariasis is made by identifying eggs or adults in stools , biopsy specimens of infected organs , or by autopsy ( 1 , 7 ) . in the present case , this small diameter was enough to allow them to be differentiated from c. aerophila and c. hepatica , and was most similar to that reported for c. philippinensis ( 1 , 2 , 8) . capillarid 's eggs are operculated with inconspicuous flattened bipolar plugs , and have a striated eggshell ( 1 , 2 ) . in the present case , eggshell morphology was similar to that of genus capillaria . however , egg size was not identical to any reported species of human capillariasis . as compared with three species of human capillariasis , egg length was similar to that of c. hepatica ( 51 - 68 m ) ( 2 ) , but diameters were not . in fact , egg diameters in the described case were between those of c. philippinensis ( 21 m ) and c. hepatica ( 30 - 35 m ) ( 2 , 8) . however , since no whole worm was isolated , it was very difficult to extend the identification to the species level . the problem of species identification is compounded by variations in host specificity and habitat . adult c. philippinensis worms in the human digestive tract are usually found in the mucosa of the small intestine from the lower third of the duodenum to the proximal third of the ileum , and although they have been found in the luminal fluid of the larynx , esophagus , stomach , and colon this was attributed to postmortem migration ( 7 ) . therefore , true gastric capillariasis has not been reported in man . however , the stomach is a common habitat in cases of animal capillariasis ( 6 ) . thus , accidental infection by an animal capillarid is a possibility in the present case . it is well known that intestinal capillaria worms usually cause severe pathologic changes , such as , loss of a villous architecture , crypt abscess composed of eosinophils , vascular congestion , and focal hemorrhage ( 1 , 4 , 7 ) . in the present case , similar pathologic features were observed in the biopsied specimen of an accidental gastric infection caused by another trichinellidae , trichuris tichiura ( 9 ) . in general , the severity of mucosal damage caused by any gastrointestinal helminth is proportional to the number of worms present . in the present case , no egg was found to be developing into a larva , which implies that autoinfection and hyperinfection were not possible ( 1 ) . thus , it is suspected that the pathogenicities of intestinal and gastric capillariasis differ . some fresh- or brackish - water fish are considered to be natural intermediate hosts for various capillaria species ( 1 , 2 ) . our patient had consumed raw freshwater fish ( about one year previously ) and brackish - water fish ( about three months previously ) . thus , in view of the onset of her gastric symptom , the two species of brackish - water fish , namely , the gizzard shad or the purple pike conger , which were both caught in coastal waters , were probably responsible . another possible source of infection was the raw chicken meat she had eaten two months previously . some fish - eating birds , including the chicken , are potential definitive hosts and autoinfection has also been reported in birds ( 10 ) . in conclusion , we describe an accidental gastric infection caused by capillaria species . an endoscopic biopsy revealed superficial gastritis with eosinophil infiltration . unlike intestinal capillariasis , gastric capillariasis extremely rare in man . its clinical symptoms are nonspecific , and for these reasons the infection is easily overlooked by patients and even by physicians . however , the possibility of gastric involvement should be carefully considered in gastritis patients infected with capillaria species .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'giant cell arteritis ( gca ) , also known as temporal arteritis ( ta ) , is an autoimmune disease and the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 . it is regarded as one of the possible underlying causes of secondary headaches in the elderly . in terms of harmful effects , it is considered a neurological emergency and it is recommended that upon clinical suspicion , treatment be initiated promptly to prevent irreversible damage . gca involves medium and large arteries in the head , neck , and upper part of the body . branches of the external and internal carotid arteries are particularly susceptible and their involvement leads to the classic manifestations of visual loss , headache , scalp tenderness , and jaw claudication . jaw claudication is a prominent symptom of gca described as pain in the jaw during mastication or speaking and results from ischemic maxillary artery supplying the masseter muscles . the headache is described by patients as throbbing in nature and usually occurs in both temples . the prevalence is higher in scandinavian countries , which is twice as much as other european countries . the age of onset of gca is usually greater than 50 years ; however , it is most commonly seen in patients between 70 and 80 years of age . females have a higher incidence than males with a female to male ratio of 3:1 . tension - type headache is classified by the international headache society as a primary headache . this pain originates typically in the forehead and bilaterally spreads to the occiput , ultimately reaching the neck muscles . the pain is classified under the category of tightening and non - pulsating and is not accompanied by nausea or any other elements of migraine symptomology . due to its nature as a primary type , tension - type headaches are not caused by any endogenous neural dysfunction or disease , whereas gca is caused by inflammation of the arteries . a detailed history and physical examination is essential for accurate diagnosis , especially if gca presents with atypical features . since gca is a treatable condition , it is important to make the correct diagnosis to prevent the potential complication of irreversible vision loss . corticosteroids remain the gold - standard treatment for gca . herein , we report a case of an elderly female , who presented with clinical features akin to tension - type headache one year prior to her correct diagnosis of gca . an 81-year - old woman was referred to our clinic with the chief complaint of a newly developed onset headache , which occurred on a daily basis and was localized in the left occipital area . however , a few months later , the pain involved the parietal region as well . the pain was nocturnal , causing her to wake up 3 to 4 times on average per night . furthermore , the patient described the headaches as throbbing in nature , no nausea or vomiting , no history of light sensitivity , and no aura or focal motor or sensory symptoms . her neurological examination was unremarkable . a ct scan of the head displayed moderate cerebral atrophy but was otherwise unremarkable . she continued to use over - the - counter analgesic medications with temporary relief of her headaches . one year later , she was presented to the ophthalmology clinic with left visual disturbances . in addition to this , she had symptoms of bilateral jaw claudication and an elevated crp of 59 . she subsequently underwent a temporal artery biopsy on the left side , which was positive for gca . she was treated with corticosteroids and responded well to the treatment ; however , her visual acuity did not improve . the inflammation of large- and medium - sized arteries in gca is thought to be due to an antigen - mediated autoimmune response . clinically , gca has a broad spectrum of associated symptoms , with the most common being headache ( 70 - 90% ) , jaw claudication ( 40 - 60% ) , transient ischemic attack ( 4% ) , neck pain , scalp tenderness , and visual disturbances . the american college of rheumatology ( acr ) has devised a set of criteria for temporal arteritis which requires that at least three of the following conditions be met : ( i ) patient age > 50 years , ( ii ) new onset of headache , ( iii ) temporal artery tenderness , ( iv ) elevated esr , and ( v ) abnormal findings of temporal artery biopsy . however , acr criteria are utilized best for classification purposes and are not validated for use in clinical diagnosis . interestingly , our patient had only occipital pain without developing any temporal pain . this is an atypical presentation of gca , which potentially contributed to the delayed diagnosis and her subsequent serious complication of irreversible visual loss . the visual symptoms of gca can include amaurosis , diplopia , and visual loss which are due to ischemic optic neuropathy , and visual symptoms may develop months after the initial symptoms onset . about 20 to 50% of patients develop ischemia of the optic nerve , leading to irreversible blindness . before other manifestations of gca are experienced , patients may complain of pain in their teeth , jaw , ear , or zygoma . corticosteroids are administered and improvements in systemic symptoms and normalization of crp or esr are noted . the duration of corticosteroid therapy is variable and can extend to several years depending upon patient needs . eular guidelines provide several recommendations and mention other pharmacological therapies that may be helpful in the treatment of gca . furthermore , there is evidence showing a rapid response with the use of tocilizumab , an il-6r antagonizing monoclonal antibody , including normalization of gca symptoms and inflammatory markers . despite these encouraging results , randomized control trials are underway to fully confirm its efficacy in the treatment of gca . gca as a secondary headache has been subject to misdiagnoses when presented with atypical features that are more representative of other disease states as seen in our case . this has been supplemented through further evidence of other gca diagnostic dilemmas in the literature . one case report presented an elderly patient suffering from orofacial pain , which is an atypical feature of gca . in addition , kraemer et al . emphasized the importance of greater analysis into individual gca symptoms . this was elucidated in their case report as the reduction of jaw opening ( i.e. an atypical feature ) in their patient led to the misdiagnosis of gca as occipital neuritis and craniomandibular dysfunction . furthermore , gca can also be associated with other diseases such as takayasu arteritis . despite the literature being laden with several diagnostic dilemmas concerning gca , our case report is unique in terms of being the only one where gca was misdiagnosed as tension - type headache . however , our case presents an opposite dilemma , as our patient presented with atypical features of gca that were more characteristic of tension - type headache . hence , it is important to be aware of overlapping features of these conditions to prevent misdiagnoses . furthermore , a lack of clinical findings concerning gca in general can lead to an increase in misdiagnosed cases . most importantly , there is a lack of robust findings in literature concerning cases where gca presents itself as tension - type headache , which underscores the distinctiveness of our case . lastly , our case emphasizes the importance of considering gca as a potential diagnosis for elderly patients with new onset headache located in a non - temporal region . our patient had only occipital / parietal pain throughout the course of the disease , without the involvement of any temporal pain . in order to resolve similar future diagnostic dilemmas , we recommend these patients should have a full workup for gca conducted as well as checking their esr and crp levels . this may prevent the severe complications of irreversible vision loss , as was seen in our case . although the diagnosis of gca can be impeded due to the conflicts of its clinical presentation with several other neurological conditions , this unique case highlights the importance of considering gca and its atypical characteristics when patients present with features similar to tension - type headache .',\n",

she was febrile ( temperature 100f ) and tachypnic ( respiratory rate 34 per minute ) ; her heart rate was 110 bpm and blood pressure was 90/60 mmhg . on systemic examination , air entry was reduced and crepitations were audible more on the right side ;

cerebrospinal fluid examination , performed in view of altered sensorium , was normal . repeated urine and blood culture samples taken during the hospital stay failed to grow any organism . computed tomography ( ct ) of the abdomen revealed the presence of gas in the right pelvicalyceal system and renal parenchyma , with air and debris in dilated right ureter . the diagnosis of epn was made and the patient was managed with oxygen inhalation , intravenous fluids in the form of normal saline , and insulin infusion to achieve euglycemia . empiric intravenous antibiotics in the form of pipericillin , tazobactum , and metronidazole were administered . because of persistent fever , hypotension and worsening renal functions , the antibiotic spectrum was broadened in the form of addition of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin . the patient 's clinical condition started improving around the 4 day of treatment and ncct on the 5 day revealed marked improvement in the form of decrease in the size and extent of epn [ figure 1b ] . after 3 weeks , another ncct abdomen revealed complete disappearance of features of epn [ figure 1c ] . after this , parenteral antibiotics were stopped and the patient was put on oral third - generation cephalosporin ( cefpodoxime proxitel + clavulanate ) and ciprofloxacin . she was on oral diet and was discharged on two doses of premixed ( 30/70 ) insulin at the end of 4 weeks . when reviewed after two more weeks ( a ) non - contrast ct ( ncct ) of abdomen at admission revealing gas in the right pelvicalyceal system and renal parenchyma , with air and debris in dilated right ureter suggestive of epn ; ( b ) ncct on the 5th day revealing decrease in the size and extent of epn ; ( c ) ncct after 3 weeks revealing complete disappearance of features of epn lab parameters of the patient during hospital stay first described in 1898 , epn is an acute necrotizing parenchymal and peri - renal infection caused by gas forming uropathogens . four factors have been proposed to have a role in the development of epn : gas forming bacteria , high blood glucose , damaged tissue perfusion , and impaired immune response . the disease predominantly affects women , with the left kidney being more frequently involved whereas both kidneys are involved in about 510% of the reported series.[51315 ] though 90% of the reported cases have occurred in diabetic patients , epn has also been reported in debilitated , alcoholic , and immunocompromised patients . most patients with epn are severely ill with fever , chills , flank pain , lethargy , confusion associated with medical problems . a typical feature of epn seen on conventional radiography is the presence of gas outlining ureters and pelvicalyceal system . ultrasound findings include high - amplitude shadowing along the non - dependent surfaces , causing obscuration of the posterior structures . the gas appeared as a hypoechogenic area surrounded by an echogenic ( calcific ) rim and more echogenic central stone , thus giving the appearance of a target sign . ct scan is the investigation of choice for not only making a proper diagnosis but also planning the treatment option . , based on ct appearance , divides epn into two types with different prognostic significance . type 1 is characterized by parenchymal destruction with streaky or mottled gas collection but no fluid collection . reduced immune response limits the formation of pus collection and this leads to the spread of the inflammation culminating in a fulminant course of the disease ; it carries a high mortality of around 70% . type 2 is characterized by bubbly or loculated gas within the parenchyma or collecting system with associated renal or peri - renal fluid collection . a better immune response results in the formation of pus in the kidney , leading to a slower course of the disease and better prognosis with a mortality of around 16% . a more detailed staging has been put forward by haung et al . as follows : class 1  gas in the collecting system ; class 2  gas in parenchyma without extension into the extrarenal space ; class 3a  extension of gas to perinephric space ; class 3b  extension of gas to paranephric space ; and class 4  bilateral epn or single kidney epn . our case is considered to be of group 2 according to either classification because the gas in the renal pelvis was confined to the kidney itself . patients initially presenting with thrombocytopenia , acute renal function impairment , disturbance of consciousness , and shock have very high mortality . our patient had all these adverse features at presentation , but responded well to conservative treatment . traditionally , the consensus is that mere medical treatment may not be effective and prompt nephrectomy is necessary because the mortality rate in patients treated with antibiotics alone is around 40% . success of treatment is 66% in those treated with percutaneous nephrostomy and 90% in those treated with nephrectomy . with the availability of ct and better antibiotics , a combination of better antibiotics and image - guided drainage has been put forward as an initial mode of treatment . asgari reported the case of a 45-year - old diabetic woman on oral hypoglycemic agents who had presented with epn . similarly , many individual cases have been described where a conservative treatment has been found successful with a combination of good metabolic control and antibiotics . we managed the present case conservatively with aggressive medical treatment including good and rapid control of glucose , hypoxia , sepsis , and renal failure , and the patient had a favorable outcome . we thus believe that nephrectomy is not the preferred treatment anymore for all cases of epn .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'a 63-year - old woman presented to our department with recurrent episodes of postprandial right upper quadrant abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting with recurrent episodes of cholangitis and mild acute pancreatitis . she had undergone open cholecystectomy for similar symptoms 20 years earlier but had suffered from unchanged episodes of pain and nausea after the operation which had accentuated recently . this correlated with the ercp finding , which demonstrated a massive dilation of the distal choledochal duct , morphologically todani type iii , with a short pancreatic duct of about 1.5 cm in the uncinate process ( fig . similar findings were described in the mri without revealing any tumorous or other morphologic reason for the pathologies . laboratory findings showed elevated ap ( 339 u / l ) , ggt ( 546 u / l ) and ldh ( 281 u / l ) with normal serum bilirubin , pancreatic enzymes and tumor markers ( cea , ca 19 - 9 ) . the patient underwent surgical exploration . intraoperatively , the preoperative findings were confirmed with a massive dilation of the bile duct and soft pancreatic tissue without inflammatory alterations . there were no signs of a malignant tumor neither of the bile duct nor the pancreas . consequently , a bile duct resection with dissection of the duct from the pancreatic head and excision of the papilla of vater with a small duodenal wall segment was performed ( fig . the pancreatic duct draining the uncinate process was transected during bile duct preparation , the minor pancreatic papilla was not touched . reconstruction included an end - to - side hepatico - jejunostomy and a pancreatic duct - jejunostomy end to side into the same jejunal loop with 7 - 0 pds sutures as well as a roux - en - y jejunal reconstruction . histological examination of the specimen showed morphological signs of a bile duct dilation correlating to a choledochocele with chronic inflammation and beginning fibro - sclerotic alterations of the excised distal papilla . the postoperative course was uneventful , the patient recovered quickly , abdominal drains were removed on the 4th postoperative day . at that time , pancreatic enzymes in the secretion fluid were identical to the serum equivalents within the normal range . an asymptomatic elevation of ap and ggt ( peak ap 240 u / l and ggt 340 u / l ) as a sign of a slight cholangitis was treated with levofloxacin orally . bile duct anomalies with dilative or cystic character are mainly reported in children and are commonly observed as congenital anomalies [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . usually , these cystic malformations are classified according to the system of todani , established in 1977 , although clinical practicability and prognostic relevance of this classification system is discussed controversely . in adults , several cases of cystic malformations have been reported , most of them presenting as type i and type iv [ 4 , 5 ] . type iii cysts presenting as distal choledochoceles are very rare and to our knowledge there are only 4 published cases of cystic malformations of the bile duct combined with a pancreas divisum . cystic bile duct anomalies require treatment due to two major aspects : first the clinical symptoms such as upper abdominal pain or recurrent episodes of cholangitis and pancreatitis that lead to the diagnosis in most of the cases ; second due to the malignant potency with a high risk of developing cystic adenocarcinoma of the bile duct [ 4 , 5 ] . in the reported case , the clinical symptoms were present for more than two decades before they consecutively led to the diagnosis after initial cholecystectomy had been performed for suspected cholecystolithiasis without long - lasting beneficial effects . this underlines the importance of an accurate and detailed diagnostic workup of these patients who present with rather unspecific abdominal symptoms . routine abdominal ultrasound may fail to reveal cystic malformations , especially in type iii cysts located close to the duodenal wall due to interposition of air or poor examination conditions . endoscopy , endoscopic ultrasound , ercp ( fig . 1 ) and ct or mri scan should be applied as additional diagnostic tools to evaluate the surrounding tissue and detect other possible anomalies ( e.g. pancreas divisum ) [ 7 , 8 ] . therapy of choledochal cysts should be surgical by the time of detection [ 4 , 5 , 9 ] . lipsett and locke report that an early resection of the pathologic duct structures correlates with a good outcome and a very low incidence of late malignancy . therefore , it seems inadequate to simply observe cystic bile duct anomalies after diagnosis even in asymptomatic patients . the type of surgical resection ranges from cyst excision under conservation of the bile duct up to complete bile duct resection ; even a whipple procedure may be indicated depending on the type and extent of the cystic transformation [ 4 , 5 , 9 , 10 ] . for understanding the anatomy and pathophysiology of distal pancreato - biliary duct anomalies , the evolution and variability of the ductal structures close to the papilla of vater is essential . as cystic variations of the pancreatic ducts can be a symptom of chronic pancreatitis as well as ipmn with completely different prognostic value , these anomalies must be treated with highly differentiated surgical concepts and individual patient - related therapies . we performed a combination of bile duct resection , papillectomy , hepatico - jejunostomy and jejunal reinsertion of the uncinate pancreatic duct ( fig . resection of the pre - cancerous bile duct lesion was radical , the residual major pancreatic duct was reinserted to ensure drainage of the uncinate process and prevent chronic segmental pancreatitis . besides , physiologic pancreatic drainage of the major part of the pancreas via the santorini duct was preserved as well as physiologic transduodenal food passage . however , by the time of operation there was no evidence of a malignant transformation of the cyst , which was confirmed later by histological examination . therefore , a major pancreatic resection , with the risk of a subsequent loss of exocrine or endocrine function as well as alteration of food passage , was not justified . [ 9 , 10 ] , who have published the largest series of patients with cystic bile duct lesions , recommend a life - long regular follow - up examination due to the persistent possibility of a malignant transformation of the bile duct disease after resection . due to the low incidence of cystic bile duct disease there are no standardized guidelines for follow - up procedures , besides clinical examination , transabdominal ultrasound and laboratory parameters including ap , ggt , bilirubin and ca 19 - 9 seem sufficient for standard postoperative follow - up . in conclusion , cystic bile duct lesions are rare anatomic varieties causing abdominal symptoms similar to other , especially gallbladder , pathologies . they should be taken into account in patients with these complaints and require detailed and accurate diagnostic measures . therapy should usually be a surgical resection under consideration of all particular individual anatomical features , as these bile duct anomalies represent pre - cancerous lesions and surgical therapy can be performed with low morbidity and mortality in specialized centers .',\n",

occupying lesions in the pelvic cavity , \\n involving the uterus , broad ligament , and adnexa ( figure 1 ) . the patient \\n underwent an exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia for further \\n diagnosis of the cystic mass , and ruling out of the genitourinary malignancy . preoperative laboratory evaluation including hiv antibody , \\n vdrl test , hbs antigen , and hcv antibody assay were normal . additionally , whole \\n body bone scan , chest and abdominal ct scan were also performed that revealed \\n unremarkable results . on the 10th day of her admission after obtaining the \\n informed consent , numerous ovarian and paraovarian cystic masses densely adhered to the uterus , \\n to the pelvic side wall , and to the fallopian tubes were demonstrated . one of \\n the cysts was removed completely and sent to the laboratory and this surgical \\n specimen was diagnosed as the hydatid cyst . due to extensive involvement of the \\n uterus , adnexa , and broad ligament , complete removal of the cysts and preservation \\n of the all reproductive organs was impossible ; furthermore complete removal of \\n the cysts due to the high risk of rupture could be life threatening , so after \\n obtaining the signed consent we decided to perform removal of the cysts of the \\n right adnexa and uterus with preservation of them and left side salpingoophorectomy . microscopic \\n examination disclosed the scolices of echinococcus granulosis with \\n adjacent laminated membrane and confirmed the diagnosis ( figure 2 ) . albendazole \\n ( 800 mg per day ) as adjuvant therapy was administered for 4 months \\n postoperatively . blood count and liver transaminases were checked during the \\n course of therapy which showed normal results . at 6-month follow - up the patient \\n was doing well with no detectable abnormality on follow - up ultrasound . hydatid disease is a parasitic disease \\n caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus . while \\n liver and lung are the most commonly affected areas in adults , hydatid \\n cysts may develop in almost any part of body [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] . primary hydatidosis of \\n the pelvic cavity is very rare but well documented in endemic areas such as the \\n mediterranean countries , south america , the middle east , and australia \\n  [ 1 , 3 ] . our patient is \\n the first reported case of primary hydatidosis of the pelvic cavity from iran \\n  and underlines the difficulties in the diagnosis of cases with striking \\n resemblance to malignant disease of the reproductive tract . to our knowledge , \\n the primary involvement of the pelvic cavity usually presents with pressure \\n symptoms affecting the adjacent organs   and this manifestation has been \\n reported exceedingly rare in the english literature so far . diagnosis of \\n the hydatid cyst is mainly on the basis of serologic tests and/or ultrasonography \\n and ct scan . previous history of hydatid cysts or exposure to dog and farm \\n animals should raise the suspicion of this diagnosis . following \\n the surgical diagnosis in our patient , we \\n inquired about such a history in our patient but revealed no identifiable \\n exposure . specific serological methods using specific antigens , \\n especially native agb , have been recommended for proper diagnosis because the serological \\n tests using crude antigens are sensitive , but their specificity is not \\n satisfactory . in one study , the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) \\n system is much more specific in detecting antihydatid cyst antibody than countercurrent \\n immunoelectrophresis ( cciep ) , while cciep is more sensitive in detecting \\n antihydatid cyst antibody . interestingly , \\n we carried out the cciep assay immediately \\n after the confirmatory result of the pathology that was positive for hydatid \\n cyst therefore serologic tests in the patients with suspicious diagnosis may \\n render the diagnosis of the hydatid cyst . ultrasound is an important \\n imaging modality for hydatid disease and may clearly demonstrate the floating \\n membranes , and daughter cysts characteristically seen in purely cystic lesions . \\n the ultrasonographic findings range from purely cystic lesions to a completely \\n solid appearance . in another study , cciep could detect only 62.0% of \\n cases , whereas the pathology and ultrasound results were positive for 96.3% of \\n cases . this study emphasized the usefulness of ultrasound and suggested that cciep \\n may be useful for diagnosing cystic echinococcus only in doubtful cases \\n . ct and magnetic resonance \\n imaging ( mri ) play a key role in recognizing the complications such as rupture \\n and infection of cysts associated with hydatid disease . we believe that ct scan  because of its \\n capability for better evaluation of the cystic masses , and better demonstration \\n of their extension in the pelvic cavity as well as excellent depiction of the \\n visceral organs involvement  is superior to \\n the ultrasonographic examination . the scan in suspected hydatid disease should \\n include the whole abdomen from liver to pelvis and a chest radiograph should \\n also be obtained . skin tests , complement \\n fixation , blood eosinophil count , and indirect hemagglutination tests can also \\n be used for diagnostic purpose however their tendency toward the false - positve \\n results limits their validity . the gold standard test for diagnosis of \\n hydatidosis is microscopic examination that shows the laminated membrane and scolices \\n [ 14 , 69 ] . complete removal of the \\n parasitic cysts and fluid is the major advantage of the surgery . single cysts \\n are easy to excise but due to the risk of adhesions , excision of the multiple \\n cysts may be difficult and even impossible [ 16 ] . we agree with this comment which \\n emphasizes that in the younger women , even in those with multiple cysts , every \\n effort should be made to preserve reproductive organs . as previously stated \\n in this case , extensive involvement and hard adhesion of the adnexa to the \\n adjacent cysts of the broad ligaments forced us to perform left - sided salpingoophorectomy . \\n another important problem is dealing with intraoperative spillage of the cyst \\n contents that contain protoscolices and can disseminate in tissue and grow new \\n cysts . furthermore , acute anaphylactic reaction may ensue secondary to the \\n spilled cyst fluid therefore spillage should be avoided by all means [ 2 , 48 ] . \\n the treatment of the recurrence and complications is very difficult and definition \\n of the best option needs multidisciplinary approach therefore medical therapy \\n should be applied postoperatively in the patients with multiple cysts and \\n multiple initial locations . the clinical manifestation of our case such as \\n severe weight loss , as well as the large multicystic mass of the pelvic cavity \\n erroneously \\n points us to the diagnosis of the ovarian malignancies . the current case \\n underlines the possibility of the striking resemblance between the clinical and \\n radiological manifestation of the hydatid cyst and malignant disease of the \\n reproductive organs which may make the correct preoperative diagnosis very \\n difficult . the tumor markers were not checked in our case however lack of the other evidences of the metastasis to the visceral \\n organs in the chest and abdominal ct scan and normal result of the bone scan \\n was the useful guidelines against the diagnosis of the ovarian malignancy . \\n although normal results of the tumor markers such as cea and ca-125 may be \\n found in the patients with genitourinary malignancies especially ovarian \\n cancer , we note that these markers should be \\n evaluated in the patients with the suspicious diagnosis of the genitourinary \\n malignancies . in conclusion , primary hydatidosis of the pelvic cavity should \\n always be considered in the differential diagnosis of any tumor - like growing \\n mass even in the absence of accompanying involvement of liver or other visceral \\n organs . we believe that in the cases like our patient , the most important \\n factor in diagnosis of hydatid disease of the pelvic cavity is the high index \\n of suspicion about its possibility which can provide the accurate diagnosis and \\n prevent the erroneous treatment . the \\n other important consideration is the \\n accidental rupture of hydatid cyst during surgery which may be life threatening , \\n therefore preoperative diagnosis of this \\n rare lesion is very important . the patient 's history as well as the \\n serologic tests may yield important clues about the diagnosis , furthermore the \\n radiologist 's familiarity with the imaging findings of the disease is very important \\n for earlier diagnosis and an appropriate treatment .\",\n",

boston scientific , natick , ma ) . thrombus aspiration via a catheter was performed with a 20 cc syringe . during the thrombus aspiration , anticoagulation or thrombolysis was not performed . a follow - up venography performed after thrombus aspiration showed recanalization of the left brachiocephalic vein , regression of collateral veins ( fig . 1f ) , and did n't show any thrombus capture within the unit . a ct angiography obtained two weeks after tempofilter ii placement demonstrated a patent svc with no thrombus around the filter , as well as resolution of the pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery . just one day after a follow up ct angiography , we successfully removed the filter without complication . retrieval of the filter was achieved by making a skin incision around the palpable anchoring device under local anesthesia . the unique design of the tempofilter ii consisting of a long tethering catheter and filter device with no hook is not seen with other filters and because of this , has many advantages . first , the tempofilter ii is a retrievable , temporary filter and this characteristic could make it an effective svc filter . other advantages of the tempofilter ii include a long tethering catheter , which makes filter retrieval easy and rapid due to the simple traction on the tethering catheter . its unique design , which has been mentioned in the above paragraph , makes it possible that the filter possesses a more vertical orientation within the svc ( the tethered catheter , which is fixed around inguinal area , acts like a pendulum ) . the vertical axis and the lack of tilting of the filter within the svc may increase the ability of the filter to capture clots ( 6 ) . additionally , the tempofilter ii has a decreased incidence of vena cava injury compared to other filter types , because it does not have any hooks on the filter strut . there have been several reports about complications related to hooked temporary svc filters , such as svc perforation , cardiac tamponade , and aortic injuries ( 7 - 9 ) . the tethered catheter enables the fine correction of filter position by allowing for the movement of the filter to - and - fro within the svc . usually , placement of a filter at the optimal level in the svc is more technically difficult than placement in the ivc , due to the shorter length of the optimal landing zone in the svc ( 2 ) . the use of the tempofilter ii in the svc also has several potential limitations or drawbacks . first , the tempofilter ii can not be used permanently ; it has been validated for indwelling times of up to six weeks , although the manufacturer states that retrieval is feasible and should require no additional equipment , up to three months after placement ( 5 ) . therefore , if patients need a permanent svc filter , the tempofilter ii must be replaced with another type of filter device . second , the tempofilter ii should be used in only bed - ridden patients . in mobile patients , the tethering catheter can bend or buckle due to the effect of gravity and the patient 's movement . furthermore , while the lack of hooks on the struts has benefits , this also makes the tempofilter ii filter more prone to migration within the relatively short svc . in cases where the tempofilter ii was used in the ivc , there have been reports of intracardiac migration inducing fatal outcomes ( 5 , 10 ) . a third disadvantage is that the use of the tempofilter ii is also limited by the length of the introducer sheath and the tethered catheter , making it impossible to use the tempofilter ii in tall patients . when the tempofilter ii is inserted into the svc , the tethered catheter is introduced through the common femoral vein and travels through the iliac vein , ivc , and svc . as a result , the length of tethered catheter remaining outside the body may be insufficient to withdraw the introducer sheath up to length of 70 cm . however , if the manufacturer were to provide a longer tethered catheter , this limit could be easily overcome . in conclusion second , they must be removable from any amount of organized and adherent thrombus after anticoagulation therapy has been completed and the indication for caval filtration has ceased ( 5 ) . based on these requirements and despite its drawbacks and limitations , the tempofilter ii may be one of the good options for the temporary filtration of the svc to prevent pulmonary embolisms in bed - ridden patients with upper extremity dvts .\",\n",

filled cavities interspersed in mucosa and muscularis propria and flattened cells with occasional foreign body type giant cells line the cavities . the mechanism by which gas appears in the wall of the bladder may comprise either elevated tissue glucose levels in diabetic patients which may provide a more favorable microenvironment for gas - forming microbes or urinary albumin as the substrate for gas production by urinary pathogens . also vascular compromise and diminished host response and catabolism the pathologic and clinical manifestations of emphysematous cystitis are not fully explained by bacterial gas production . plain x - ray of the abdomen and pelvis can reveal air fluid levels in the bladder or a typical cobblestone appearance . a rim of gas lucency outlining the wall of the bladder can suggest the diagnosis although the presence of bowel gas can be a problematic feature . computed tomography of the abdomen is superior to plain x - ray as a diagnostic tool because it defines the extent and location of the gas collection more precisely . it can clearly depict air in the bladder lumen or wall , and also the complication of gas presence . ct can differentiate emphysematous cystitis from emphysematous pyelonephritis , in which gas involves the renal parenchyma . the emphysematous pyelonephritis has an increased mortality and generally requires nephrectomy compared with emphysematous cystitis in which surgical intervention is rarely needed . complications of delayed diagnosis may be the extension of infection to the ureters and renal parenchyma , bladder rupture , and death . the female patient in the present case was finally diagnosed as having emphysematous cystitis , after imaging investigation . the patient 's presenting complaint consisted in abdominal pain , fever and dysuria during the previous 3 -

diagnosed as not all patients undergo radiological investigation for urinary tract infection and many cases are increasingly discovered following radiological investigation for an entirely different pathology . the routinely use of expensive imaging , however in septic , diabetic and elderly patients it should be considered in order to minimize complications . on the other hand a delay in diagnosis can lead in life threatening complications especially in septic , diabetic and elderly patients . prompt medical therapy is usually sufficient for patient recovery , but they require careful monitoring for the development of complications .   in conclusion , the radiology plays an important role in the definitive diagnosis of various conditions responsible for the presence of gas in the urinary tract . some of these diseases can be life -

old boy with no relevant medical history was presented at the oral and maxillofacial surgery department for determining the therapy for foreign bodies that were found on alio loco performed posterior - anterior and lateral radiographs of the skull ( figure 1a and b ( fig . 1 ) ) . the patient was living at a children s home and the therapy had to be clarified with the youth welfare department . the child s guardian wanted to know whether the foreign bodies could cause harm to the patient , whether there were treatment risks and whether the removal of the foreign bodies was assessed to be mandatory . on the radiographs a round foreign body with metallic absorption of x - rays was identified on the left medial border of the orbit . the lateral view suggested that the foreign body was retained in the orbital anterior part . a second foreign body was localized on the same side lateral to the vertebral column of the neck . this foreign body had also a complete absorption of x - rays as found from metallic artefacts . however , the patient remembered that , at the age of about 4 years , his older brother had shot at his head for several times from different sides , with a not identified weapon .   physical examination of the patient revealed a firm and slightly moveable foreign body of the left medial eye lid s angle , covered by an unaffected skin ( figure 1c ( fig . however , on the dorsal left paramedian side of the neck an old scar was visible , about 15 mm in largest diameter and with irregular margins , probably an old wound that was healed by granulation without medical aid . it was decided that these foreign bodies might give rise to an infection and that their removal should be anticipated . an additional imaging of the regions was worth striving for in order to define whether other organs might be affected during surgery . b - scan ultrasonography was chosen , as this diagnostic could be used without further x - ray exposure of the young patient . further , b - scan ultrasound enables the imaging of soft tissues in high resolution and excellent contrast . b - scan ultrasonography was carried out with a small - part transducer and an emission frequency of 7.5 mhz ( ultrasound equipment : sonoline omnia , siemens ag , erlangen , germany ; printer cp 700 , matsushita , kyoto , japan ) . the focus of the scanner was adjusted to the region of interest .   in the left orbital region the ultrasonogram depicted a half - circled object , with the closest point of the body surface to the applicator in its geometrical midpoint . this phenomenon was reproduceably seen in different planes following several changes of the transducer s angulation to the skin . therefore , it was likely that the foreign body had the geometrical characteristics of a sphere . it was suggested that the foreign body was an air gun pellet ( figure 2a ( fig . the foreign body was identified anterior and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle ( figure 2b ( fig . 2 ) ) . the foreign body was localized closely to the internal jugular vein . ultrasound depicted the head of the screw that was measured to be of about 10 mm in diameter . the skin landmark perpendicular to the screw was located about 5 cm anterior to the neck scar . surgery was then performed in general anaesthesia . on the left neck a skin incision was made at the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle . the screw was lying in the fat tissue surrounding the internal jugular vein and it was attached to the inner layer of the muscle . histology of the pseudocapsule revealed a scary tissue with strand - like calcifications , a foreign body reaction with formation of multinucleated giant - cells and a histiocyte infiltrate . this case report describes the successful application of b - scan ultrasonography in the topographic identification of foreign bodies in the head and neck region of an adolescent who was harmed about ten years ago . ultrasonography supported the decision - making of the surgical approach and allowed a rapid intervention . this method is cost - effective and can be recommended in the treatment planning of patients with foreign bodies of the head and neck . however , the application of ultrasonography in head and neck surgery is limited to areas where conduction of the applicator to the body surface is feasible and the transmission of ultrasound is not restricted . the alternate layers of soft and hard tissues , and air - filled spaces impair the application of ultrasound in craniomaxillofacial surgery . therefore , x - ray based imaging methods are preferred in craniomaxillofacial surgery in treatment planning , intraoperative guidance and monitoring of treatment results , , , . on the other hand , ultrasound - based imaging application can avoid ( further ) x - ray exposure of patients during the course of treatment . these waves are emitted with distinct emission frequencies at the surface of the applicator ( or transducer ) . the transmission of the ultrasonic wave into the body is facilitated by a gel , placed on the transducer that is attached to the skin at the region of interest . the returning echoes are detected by the applicator , processed to visual analogues of ultrasound and displayed in real time on the monitor screen . emission frequencies of 5 to 15 mhz are used for ultrasound imaging of the head and neck region , . ultrasound at frequencies of 5 to 15 mhz is usually not transmitted through hard tissues , e.g. bone or metal . at the interface of the transmitting body adjacent to the applicator and hard tissue a complete or partial remission of ultrasound takes place . on the monitor only the surface of the body opposite to the surface of the transducer can be seen that gives rise to ultrasound remittance . in most cases this will be a small part of the structure of interest , emphasizing that clinical ultrasonography is a dynamic investigation . the details seen on b - scan ultrasonogram have to be taken pars pro toto to identify the structure , e.g. an osteosynthesis plate . three - dimensional ultrasound offers at least under certain circumstances a partial reconstruction of the surface of an object . ultrasonography has been also recommended to be used in the assisted removal of foreign bodies that are radiolucent , , , . there are pathologic structures other than foreign bodies that might be radiolucent and that have to be differentiated on ultrasonograms , e.g. stones of salivary glands ducts , calcified sinews , calcification of the carotid arteries , and remnants of head and neck surgery like vessel clips , non - resorbed sutures , further sclerosis of deep scars in the neck ( in particular in irradiated patients ) . all these structures can cause total or a partial reflection of the ultrasound with distal shadow formation . therefore , the x - ray imaging is the first - line diagnostic tool to search for foreign body in the head and neck region . x - rays allow the complete imaging of the skull , including organs and spaces that can not reliably be visualized with ultrasound , e.g. the paranasal sinuses , throat , and brain . on the other hand , ultrasonography may be the only diagnostic tool applicable in a patient , e.g. in the situation where the guardian does not allow the application of x - rays or in pregnant women . the knowledge of the appearance of physical bodies in ultrasound is mandatory prior to the application of ultrasound in diagnostics of the head and neck . b - scan ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool to identify foreign bodies in the head and neck region . however , there are certain limitations of ultrasound , e.g. restriction to the imaging of the surface of solid foreign bodies only , and restriction to receive images in several planes perpendicular to each other in the head and neck region .',\n",

       " {'article': 'renal infarction ( ri ) is caused by sudden disruption of blood flow in the renal arteries , and rapid diagnosis and treatment is critical to prevent permanent loss of renal function . however , clinical diagnosis of ri is often difficult and frequently missed or delayed because of its low prevalence and nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal or flank pain , which are frequently found in other more common conditions such as nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis . to make an accurate diagnosis of ri , it is essential to raise a suspicion for this condition from a thorough patient medical history and to proceed with an optimal diagnostic workup . the 2 major causes of ri are systemic arterial thromboembolism , which usually originates from a thrombus in the heart or aorta , and in situ thrombus formation following injury of the renal artery , such as renal artery dissection . after ruling out in situ thrombus formation , disclosure of the pathogenesis of thrombosis and detection of thrombus is necessary to provide appropriate treatment . however , in recent reports , ris caused by atrial fibrillation decreased to 1837% , while cases without known detectable cause increased to 1330% [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] . therefore , it is important to look for previously unrecognized etiologies of ri to make accurate causal diagnoses . in this report , we present a case of ri with thrombus formation in the stump ( a blind - ended vessel ) of the left superior pulmonary vein shortly after lung resection . we also reviewed the relevant literature , which may be indicative of a causal relationship between ri and pulmonary vein thrombosis . a 43-year - old male ex - smoker , without concomitant conditions , was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and underwent a formal left upper lobectomy in combination with mediastinal lymph node sampling ( fig . the procedure was uncomplicated , but the patient received pleural adhesion therapy for the treatment of prolonged postoperative air leaks . , the patient presented to our emergency department with complaints of a sudden onset of severe flank pain located at the lower side of the left hemithorax . laboratory data showed an elevation of white blood cells ( 10,000 cells / m ) , serum lactate dehydrogenase ( 778 u / l ) , creatinine ( 0.82 mg / dl ; 0.63 mg / dl before discharge ) , c - reactive protein ( 7.75 mg / dl ) , and plasma d - dimer ( 9.18 g / ml ) . contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) of the abdomen revealed a large wedge - shaped infarction of the left kidney ( fig . the well - known causes of ri such as left atrial thrombus , ( paroxysmal ) atrial fibrillation , aortic plaque , renal artery stenosis or dissection , and deep vein thrombosis with right - to - left shunt were not identified by evaluations including transthoracic echocardiogram , ambulatory electrocardiography , renal artery ct angiography , and lower limbs venous ultrasonography . in addition , his laboratory evaluation for inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states , such as protein c or protein s deficiencies and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , were negative . these results were consistent with idiopathic ri . however , because the onset was shortly after lung resection , an explorative contrast - enhanced ct scan of the chest was performed . the ct scan revealed thrombus in the stump of the left superior pulmonary vein ( fig . anticoagulation therapy was initiated with continuous intravenous heparin injection ( 10,000 units per day ) and followed by warfarin therapy to maintain control of pt - inr between 1.5 and 2.0 . laboratory findings worsened over the following 3 days ( lactate dehydrogenase 1,530 u / l ; creatinine 0.95 mg / dl ) but then gradually returned to normal . under anticoagulation therapy , renal functions partially recovered ( creatinine 0.75 mg / dl ) within 1 month , and the pulmonary vein thrombosis resolved within 2 months with no additional peripheral infarction ( fig . after cessation of anticoagulation therapy , there was no recurrence of pulmonary vein thrombosis throughout the follow - up period . after an extended evaluation , a thrombus was detected in the stump of the left superior pulmonary vein . because none of the known causes of ri were detectable in our patient , thromboembolic ri caused by a pulmonary vein thrombosis was strongly suspected . according to the literature , risk factors of thromboembolic ri , other than atrial fibrillation , include valvular or ischemic heart disease , endocarditis , hypercoagulation disorders , and hematological diseases . because thromboembolic ris are arterial vascular events , detection of thrombus begins with transthoracic echocardiogram to disclose intra - atrial thrombus . subsequently , the presence of a thrombus at the atherosclerotic and/or aneurysmatic aorta is examined in usual causal diagnosis workup . however , origins of thromboembolism are not limited to systemic arterial circulation . for example , in cases with atrial septal defects or patent foramen ovale , venous thrombus may transverse from the venous system to the systemic arterial circulation to cause thromboembolic ri . another exception is the pulmonary vein , which carries arterial blood to the left atrium . after major lung resection , a stump of the pulmonary vein is created , and a thrombus generated in the stump may easily enter the systemic circulation and cause thromboembolic ri . to the best of our knowledge , only 5 cases of ri following lung resections have been reported [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ( table 1 ) and none of these cases had detectable well - known causes of ri . one patient , who suffered from ri 13 months after surgery , had a graphically confirmed pulmonary vein thrombosis similar to our case . the remaining 4 patients who had ri in the early postoperative period [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] were diagnosed as idiopathic ri , which may be correlated with the postoperative [ 6 , 10 ] and/or paraneoplastic [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] hypercoagulable state . however , the co - existence of thrombus in the pulmonary vein was not examined in 3 cases [ 6 , 8 , 10 ] and not mentioned in 1 case   because pulmonary vein thrombosis have not been previously described as risk factors for ri . there were 5 other reported cases with peripheral embolic events other than ri after lung resection with graphically detectable pulmonary vein thrombosis [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] ( table 2 ) . assessing similarities between these cases , ri occurred after left upper lobectomy in all cases [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] , and all thrombi were detected in the left superior pulmonary vein [ 7 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] . based on this similarity , we speculate that pulmonary vein thrombosis after left upper lobectomy is an unrecognized risk factor for thromboembolic ri . thrombus in the stump of the pulmonary vein has rarely been reported and has been thought to be a very rare phenomenon until the past few years . however , nagaoka et al .   reported that 2 of 31 patients developed a thrombus in the stump of the pulmonary vein after lung resection . in addition , ohtaka et al .   reported that 7 of 193 patients had thrombus after lung resection , all of which were detected in cases with left upper lobectomy . from these reports , pulmonary vein thrombosis seems to be a more frequent complication following lung resection than recognized previously . in contrast , there are a few reports suggesting a relationship between pulmonary vein thrombosis and peripheral infarction . this might be because the pulmonary vein stump is usually not examined as a potential origin of thromboembolism , and therefore , this relationship might be underdiagnosed . in our patient and 1 previously reported ri case with successful detection of pulmonary vein thrombosis , anticoagulation therapy was indicated to treat ri and to prevent further embolic episodes . in both cases , however , the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of the reformation of a thrombus after cessation of anticoagulation therapy are not well defined . because there are so few reported cases , further investigation of the optimal treatment of these conditions is necessary . in summary , we encountered an unusual case of ri , which was likely caused by pulmonary vein thrombosis following left upper lobectomy . in addition , the occurrence of thrombus formation in the stump of the left superior pulmonary vein is more frequent than presumed previously . therefore , a history of left upper lobectomy should be considered as a potential risk factor for ri , and pulmonary vein thrombosis needs to be regarded as an origin of thromboembolism to make an accurate causal diagnosis of ri .',\n",

korsakoff syndrome in a patient with primary peritoneal cancer . a 76-year - old woman with primary peritoneal cancer and multiple lymph node metastases received 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin . six months after her last chemotherapy cycle , she was admitted to the hospital because of sustained nausea and general weakness , which she had experienced for several months . chest and abdominal - pelvic computed tomography scans showed that peritoneal metastasis and lymph node metastasis had progressed . four days after admission , she developed disorientation and dizziness , which were followed by ataxia and diplopia . her laboratory findings were as follows : white blood cell count 6.59  10/l , hemoglobin 12.0 g / dl , hematocrit 35.8% , blood platelet count 230  10/l , serum total protein 6.1 g / dl , albumin 3.3 g / dl , glucose 111 mg / dl , aspartate aminotransferase 21 iu , alanine aminotransferase 14 iu , blood urea nitrogen 9.0 mg / dl , creatinine 0.15 mg / dl , na 139 mm , k 4.6 mm , cl 107 mm , and ca 0.98 mg / dl . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain showed hyperintensity in the mammillary body , medial aspects of both halves of the thalamus , cerebral aqueduct , tectal plate , and dorsal medulla on t2 fluid -

up mri scan of the brain showed improvement in the abnormal lesion ( fig . the classic clinical triad of wernicke encephalopathy comprises nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia , changes in mental status , and ataxia . predisposing factors for wernicke encephalopathy include a staple diet of polished rice , chronic alcohol abuse , chronic malnutrition , gastrointestinal surgical procedures , recurrent vomiting , chronic diarrhea , cancer , use of chemotherapeutic agents , systemic disease , magnesium depletion , the use of chemical compounds ( including drugs ) , and unbalanced nutrition . thiamine is an important coenzyme in intermediated carbohydrate metabolism , lipid metabolism , the production of amino acids , and the production of glucose - derived neurotransmitters . thiamine deficiency mainly results in changes to the macroscopic and microscopic findings of brain lesions . notably , 100% of patients with wernicke encephalopathy show typical histopathological changes in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus . additionally , one third of patients show histopathological changes in the superior vermis of the cerebellum . several reports have shown that some cases of thiamine deficiency are related to cancer [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . causes of thiamine deficiency in cancer patients include the use of thiamine by fast - growing neoplastic cells , poor dietary intake ( which is related to appetite and nausea ) , significant malabsorption , and the use of specific types of chemotherapeutic agents . in the present case , thiamine deficiency was probably related to fast - growing neoplastic cells and poor dietary intake . the patient recovered completely from ophthalmoplegia after a few hours , from ataxia after a few days , and from mental changes after 23 weeks of thiamine replacement therapy . however , irreversible brain damage or death occurs in approximately 20% of cases of wernicke encephalopathy , and the chronic irreversible form of the encephalopathy ( korsakoff syndrome ) is associated with a survival rate of approximately 85% . in the present case , however , she developed new symptoms of anterograde amnesia and disorientation with respect to time . many reports have described cases of wernicke encephalopathy in patients with cancer , but korsakoff syndrome has not been reported in such patients . indeed , this is the first reported case of wernicke - korsakoff syndrome in a patient with primary peritoneal cancer . in addition , it is difficult to diagnose wernicke encephalopathy if the patient has developed neurologic symptoms related to his or her cancer , because neurologic symptoms in patients with cancer can be related to many factors , such as electrolyte imbalance , cerebral metastasis , chemotherapeutic treatments , infection , and opioid overdose . to diagnose wernicke encephalopathy , wernicke encephalopathy is confirmed by measuring blood thiamine concentration or red blood cell transketolase activity . in our case , the blood thiamine level was 2.0 g / dl , which is the lower limit of normal . an isocratic high - performance liquid chromatography method for thiamine , thiamine phosphate , and thiamine diphosphate in human erythrocytes is suitable for diagnosing wernicke encephalopathy , but this test was not available . mri is a valuable tool for confirming a diagnosis of wernicke encephalopathy ; it has a high specificity of 93% and a sensitivity of 53% . in the present case , a follow - up mri scan showed improvement in the previously abnormal findings , but korsakoff syndrome remained . primary peritoneal cancer is a rare cancer with a behavior that is very similar to epithelial ovarian cancer . the development of wernicke encephalopathy has been reported in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer , head and neck cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , lymphoma , and leukemia ; however , wernicke - korsakoff syndrome has not been reported previously in patients with primary cancers [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] . the case reported here involved wernicke - korsakoff syndrome in a patient with primary peritoneal cancer . therefore , clinicians should consider wernicke encephalopathy in cancer patients with risk factors for this disease , such as nutritional imbalance due to long - term parenteral nutritional supply , use of chemotherapeutic agents , and fast - growing tumor cells . clinicians should remember that wernicke encephalopathy occurs in patients with unbalanced nutrition , as well as in those with subacute or chronic disease that increases metabolism .\",\n",

there was no immunoreactivity for cd45 ( lca ) . due to the widespread nature of the tumor in the upper abdomen and the inconclusive anatomopathological examination , the patient underwent surgery in a university center ( uz leuven ) . in june 2011 , the anatomopathological examination was compatible with a net originating from the pancreatic tail , which could have arisen from an intrasplenic pancreatic remnant . microscopically , the tumor was strongly vascularized , with a heterogeneous population of tumor cells and varying atypical nuclei . immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse membrane expression of prekeratin and inhibin , partial expression of epithelial membrane antigen , a focal , dot - like expression of ck7 , a weak partial expression of synaptophysin and a strong diffuse expression of ck20 . a focal expression of melana was also observed , while neurofilament and calretinin were not expressed . the tumor had invaded the spleen and peripancreatic fat , which was resected in toto . the tumor was diagnosed as a stage ii pancreatic net , with a ki67 index of 10% . since the pet / ct scan in the initial staging showed no metastases , no treatment was initiated but a close clinical , biochemical and radiological follow - up was planned . in october 2011 , an increase in the level of the tumor marker chromogranin a was noted during follow - up laboratory testing . a ct scan of the abdomen revealed a hypercaptating lesion of approximately 3.5 cm , located at the residual part of the pancreatic corpus , without enlargement of the pancreas . due to its hypervascular character , because of this early relapse after extensive surgical resection , we initiated treatment with a lar formulation of octreotide ( sandostatin lar 30 mg , novartis ) , administered intramuscularly once a month . the control ct scan in january 2012 revealed multiple small lesions with early arterial enhancement in the parenchyma of the liver , indicative of hypervascular metastases ( fig . however , the patient presented no symptoms and biochemical tests showed normal liver function . due to difficulties with the administration of the sandostatin lar injections ( the nurses reported difficulties with handling the syringes and with making a homogeneous solution ) , the treatment was switched to lanreotide autogel 120 mg ( somatuline autogel , ipsen nv ) , administered once a month . this long - acting somatostatin analog is provided as a prefilled syringe and is administered deep - subcutaneously in the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks . no difficulties with the administration of lanreotide autogel 120 mg were encountered , and the patient reported no side effects . chromogranin and neuron - specific enolase levels were also assessed and were found to be normalizing . deterioration in the clinical status of the patient and weight loss were noted from november 2013 on . a ct scan revealed an increase in the size of the liver lesions and presence of peritoneal metastases with a low level of ascites ( fig . 3d , e ) . a chemotherapy course consisting of 6 cycles of cisplatinum - etoposide this treatment was chosen above newer targeted therapies , such as sunitinib and everolimus , because of the aggressive evolution of the pancreatic net in our patient . the chemotherapy was administered every 3 weeks according to the following schedule : day 1 , cisplatinum 80 mg / m ;

old male was referred to our unit with complaints of progressive swelling of his legs and weight gain of approximately 5 kg . thereafter , he had received combination treatment with oral voglibose and nateglinide , which had kept his hba1c levels between 6 and 7% . his serum creatinine ( scr ) levels had increased gradually during the last two years . he had noticed the symptoms about three months before the referral , when his level of blood scr was 1.7 mg / dl . he denied the use of any drugs , and his medical histories included hypertension and hyperlipidemia for more than 10 years . tests for hepatitis b virus surface antigens and antibodies to the hepatitis c virus were negative . renal sonography showed that the renal dimensions of the right kidney measured 113  60 mm , while those of the left kidney measured 115  66 mm , and the degree of renal cortex echogenicity was normal . the patient s urine was 3 + for protein and contained 8.9 g of protein in a 24 hour specimen . his proteinuria selectivity index and creatinine clearance were 0.325 and 78.8 ml / minute , respectively . an ophthalmologic analysis revealed the patient to have simple diabetic retinopathy . on the other hand , the latex - agglutination test for fecal occult blood was positive ( 124 ng / ml ) despite the absence of remarkable findings in the diagnostic thoracoabdominal computed tomography scan , and thus , endoscopic analyses of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts were performed . the presence of sigmoid colon polyps , which consisted of adenomatous tissue , was confirmed , while the gastric biopsy specimens revealed the presence of a well - differentiated adenocarcinoma confined to the submucosa . endoscopic mucosal resection ( emr ) was finally performed three months after the referral , confirming that the neoplastic tissue was of type 0iic based on the paris endoscopic classification of superficial neoplastic lesions,3 with a well - differentiated adenocarcinoma ( fig . eight months after the emr , he was negative at occult fecal blood test but continued to exhibit nephrotic syndrome with a urine protein level of 3.69 g / g  cr , an salb of 2.7 g / dl , and an scr level of 2.04 mg / dl , and he was thus subjected to a pathological evaluation . the renal biopsy consisted of three cores of renal parenchyma with 32 glomeruli , almost half of which were globally sclerotic . there were glomeruli with hyalinotic lesions , globally widened mesangial regions , and a number of rounded acellular mesangial nodules ; and also interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes , atrophic changes in the tubule structure , interstitial fibrosis , and arteriolar hyalinization were identified ( fig . immunofluorescence staining failed to demonstrate the linear staining of igg along the glomerular capillary wall . instead , the presence of focal deposits of igm in the depending portions of the areas of hyalinosis was confirmed . electron microscopy failed to show the presence of electron - dense deposits on the subepithelium of the glomerular basement membrane , which is a suggestive finding of membranous nephropathy.4 based on the renal pathological findings , combined with the patient s clinical pictures , he was finally diagnosed to have nephrotic syndrome due to diabetic nephropathy , and treatment with olmesartan medoxomil at 20 mg / day , amlodipine besilate at 5 mg / day , and furosemide at 80 mg / day , which had been started after the referral , as well as the oral hypoglycemic agents described above , was continued . despite the absence of any exacerbation of the blood pressure control , his renal function gradually declined and a periodic hemodialysis program finally commenced 21 months after the renal biopsy . performing a renal biopsy for proteinuric diabetics has usually been considered when the presence of a renal disease other than diabetic nephropathy is suggested by clinical signs , such as rapid deterioration of the renal function , microscopic or macroscopic hematuria , and proteinuria in newly diagnosed diabetics without retinopathy or neuropathy.57 on the other hand , the association of chronic renal insufficiency , nephrotic syndrome , and diabetes with microangiopathic complications such as retinopathy makes a diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy probable , diminishing the need for a renal biopsy.5,8,9 however , several recent studies have suggested a morphological analysis of the kidney to be of value for the overall management of patients with diabetic nephropathy,510 implying the diagnostic potential of such a procedure in the overall assessment for diabetics with various renal manifestations . considering the clinical picture of our patient at the referral , one might have straightforwardly attributed the nephrotic syndrome to diabetic nephropathy without pathological confirmation , and might even argue that the patient s renal pathological findings were not surprising . however , the clinical significance of the current case should be considered carefully in terms of the fact that the concurrent gastric carcinoma was found before arriving at the conclusion that the nephrotic syndrome was etiologically linked to diabetic glomerular injuries . nephrotic syndrome has been a focus of studies as one of the pivotal manifestations of the glomerular damage associated with various kinds of neoplasms,1113 while membranous nephropathy , one of the most common causes of adult nephrotic syndrome worldwide,14 is the most common paraneoplastic glomerulopathy associated with solid tumors.1113 the main problem is to determine how thorough the search for neoplasia should be in such nephrotic subjects . experts recommend performing basic routine cancer screening procedures , including chest radiography , an occult blood survey of stool specimens , colonoscopy , and measurements of the carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) and prostate - specific antigen levels , especially in older patients with newly diagnosed membranous nephropathy without any other obvious causes . in addition , further investigations , such as bronchoscopy , gastroscopy , and ct , may be in order after the first - line assessment.11,13 however , although some of these examinations may be carried out in the ordinary clinical setting,7,15 the extent of the workup depends on the judgment of the primary physician . on the other hand , the validity of such a policy among the nephrotic patients whose renal pathological diagnoses are lacking or those with glomerulopathy other than membranous nephropathy remains to be established . we believe , however , that there are some subsets of nephrotic patients who would benefit from the screening for malignancies , as described in the current report . otherwise , we might have overlooked the concurrent gastric carcinoma in the present case if we had simply ascribed the nephrotic syndrome to diabetic nephropathy regardless of the presence or absence of the pathological confirmation and had failed to perform upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , which led us to promptly identify the disease . fecal immunochemical tests are recommended as the first - choice modality for colorectal cancer screening in average - risk populations,16 although the current evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine surveys to detect gastric or esophageal carcinoma in patients with characteristics similar to those of our patient , ie , positivity for fecal occult blood with negativity on colonoscopy , based on a population - based colorectal cancer screening program.17 nevertheless , it has been shown that performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with a positive fecal occult blood test alone is not exceptional , even in the field of gastroenterology.18 we believe that the flexible application of such procedures should be mandatory in nephrotic subjects with these characteristics . an alternative concern raised from the current case is the role of a renal histological analysis in cancer patients with various renal manifestations , including nephrotic syndrome . in patients with carcinomas that are incurable at the moment of diagnosis , a renal biopsy may not be indicated.11 although the relationship between malignancies and nephrotic glomerulopathies is somewhat difficult to prove , it may be suggested by clinical characteristics , such as a close temporal link and parallel evolution , including improvement , resolution , and relapse.1113,15 moreover , we should bear in mind that the time to remission of nephrotic syndrome after successful treatment of a malignancy can often be months to years.11,12,19 nevertheless , the persistence of nephrotic syndrome with a progression of chronic renal failure in the current patient obliged us to perform a histological survey in view of the possibility of finding a potentially reversible glomerular lesion.7 one may argue that pathological assessment of the kidney is not warranted in the milieu of chronic renal insufficiency20 ; however , there was a clinical benefit to performing a renal biopsy in the present patient , because it led us to conclude that the presence of a latent relationship between nephrotic syndrome and gastric malignancy was unlikely , and that our patient was incidentally complicated with gastric carcinoma . in the current case , we faced , as do most physicians at various times , diagnostic dilemmas , not only as to whether to perform a renal biopsy but also with respect to how long it is possible to wait to perform a renal biopsy despite progressive deterioration of the patient s renal function . the establishment of an optimal management strategy for diabetic patients with both malignancies and various renal manifestations is therefore a matter requiring continuous and careful attention .',\n",

old male , a resident of ohio with a history of deceased donor kidney transplantation 2 years previously due to hypertensive end - stage renal disease , presented with fever , night sweats and malaise of several weeks duration . post - transplant , the patient had no rejection episodes and he was maintained on a stable immunosuppressive regimen that included mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice a day and sirolimus 6 mg daily . on admission , the patient appeared well and was in no acute distress . laboratory data revealed a slightly increased white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 10 400/l ( differential : 81.7% granulocytes , 12.2% monocytes and 2.9% lymphocytes ) . a chest x - ray showed a small indistinct opacity in the right lung base . a computed tomography ( ct ) chest revealed right lower lobe airspace disease , a few bilateral pulmonary nodules , the largest being 7 mm , a 2.3  2.3 cm necrotic subcarinal node and no other significant lymphadenopathy . the patient was started on empirical intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin / tazobactam on admission with a presumed diagnosis of community - acquired pneumonia but the fever persisted . the subsequent negative workup included a urinalysis , serum cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , bk virus pcr , epstein  barr virus pcr , respiratory viral panel pcr done on nasopharyngeal swab , serum cryptococcal antigen , serum aspergillus galactomannan assay , urine histoplasma antigen , serial blood and urine cultures , serologies for hiv , brucella , rickettsiae , q fever , bartonella and endemic fungi ( histoplasma , coccidioides , blastomyces ) , tuberculosis interferon - gamma release assay , rapid plasma reagin , rheumatoid factor , anti - nuclear antibody , serum cryglobulin and serum and urine protein electrophoresis . based on the findings on chest imaging , a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) were performed and sent for cell count , bacterial culture , respiratory viral pathogen nucleic acid testing and general viral culture and fungal and acid - fast bacillus analysis . cytology of the bal fluid showed 71% macrophages , 12% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes but other tests were reported to be negative . other negative diagnostic workup included a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis , whole body wbc scan and a bone marrow biopsy . as fever continued , we also entertained the possibility of malignancy or lymphoma . it was important to figure out whether the single large necrotic - looking subcarinal lymph node seen on chest ct scan in absence of other lymphadenopathy was significant or not and whether we were dealing with a more systemic process . a pet scan ( figure 1 ) it showed increased [ 18f]-fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) uptake in mediastinal , hilar , supraclavicular , retroclavicular and periaortic lymph nodes . thus , the pet scan confirmed the systemic disease and showed that necrotic - looking subcarinal lymph node enlargement was significant. a media stinoscopy with subcarinal lymph node biopsy was then performed to better characterize the etiology of lymphadenopathy . pathology revealed non - caseating granulomas ( figure 2 ) with small yeast forms suggestive of histoplasma capsulatum ( figure 3 ) . the patient was initiated on itraconazole capsule 200 mg bid but as the serum itraconazole level 10 days later was detected to be low at 0.6 mcg / ml , he was switched to the liquid formulation ( to allow better absorption ) at the same dose . with the liquid form , the patient achieved a target level of 1 mcg / ml , and hence , he was continued on the same regimen . so far , the patient has completed 8 months of itraconazole for a total of 12 months and has remained afebrile . he required reduction in the dose of sirolimus at the beginning of the therapy because the drug  drug interaction between itraconazole and sirolimus resulted in a significant increase in the drug level of the sirolimus . the patient has maintained a stable graft function till the time of last follow - up . the epithelioid non - necrotizing granulomas with giant cells ( arrows ) in the lymph node . please see the additional color image ( hemotxylin & eosin stain ) as supplementary material online . please see the additional color image ( gomori s methenamine - silver stain ) as supplementary material online . the immunocompromised host can have falsely negative serologic studies ( using the immunodiffusion and complement fixation methods ) owing to ineffective and/or impaired antibody responses to infection . the advent of fungal antigen testing by enzyme immunoassay has facilitated the diagnosis in these patients and should be done routinely in febrile transplant patients . however , such tests are currently available for a limited set of pathogens . such limitations often lead clinicians to approach management of such cases with empiric therapy . in the absence of clinical response , the diagnosis may require surgical pathology specimens . this case illustrates that histoplasmosis in the solid organ transplant recipient may cause a major diagnostic dilemma . in the patient presenting with fever of unknown origin , the difficulty lies in differentiating it from other fungal infections , tuberculosis , sarcoidosis , lymphoma and malignancy . in the above patient , the diagnosis of histoplasmosis remained elusive due to an absence of significant pulmonary symptoms and chest imaging findings , negative blood cultures and a negative bal . the histoplasma serology was negative in our patient , as the test is known to have a poor sensitivity in solid organ transplant recipients , especially in acute cases . although urinary histoplasma antigen testing has been reported to be up to 9095% sensitive in making a diagnosis of histoplasmosis [ 5 , 6 ] , the test remained negative in this case on several occasions , likely reflecting a lack of wide dissemination of disease . the sensitivity of antigen detection in acute disseminated histoplasmosis is reported to be higher in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients and in patients with more severe disease . in contrast , the false - negative histoplasmosis antigen results have been reported in patients with mild disease , pulmonary versus disseminated disease and in those with negative blood cultures   and may occur in up to 1020% of disseminated cases in immunocompromised individuals , including those with organ transplantation but without aids [ 4 , 7 ] . the histoplasma antigen testing of bal may provide rapid diagnosis in some instances   but was not done in our patient . moreover , this test is not widely available , and its role in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis remains unclear [ 7 , 9 ] . fungal stains and cultures of the bone marrow aspirate and the bone marrow biopsy were also unrevealing for histoplasma infection ; this result was not surprising given a lack of significant cytopenia . in previously reported series of histoplasmosis in solid organ transplant recipients , the diagnosis was aided by a positive antigen test , culture or serology in all the patients [ 1 , 10 , 11 ] . in our patient , these tests were unrevealing and ultimately , pet scan was helpful in focusing attention on metabolically active tissue . pet scan has been reported to be helpful in the diagnosis and staging of invasive fungal infections , especially when lesions are unapparent on the corresponding ct . indeed , biopsy of the pet - avid nodes finally established the diagnosis . in summary , the diagnosis of post - transplant histoplasmosis can be challenging due to poor sensitivity of serological tests in solid organ transplant recipients , uncertain role of molecular diagnostic methods ( pcr ) and falsely negative results obtained with antigen tests in less severe cases . pet scan may aid in the detection of small but metabolically active lymph nodes when lymphadenopathy is not yet conspicuous on the ct in the early and less severe cases of post - transplant histoplasmosis .',\n",

       " {'article': 'vertebral artery ( va ) injury ( vai ) during cervical spine surgery is a rare , but it can be serious complication with the potential to cause massive bleeding , permanent neurologic impairment , and even death . most reports of vai are related to anterior surgical exposure or screw placement in the posterior cervical spine and the overall incidence during cervical spine surgery ranges from 0.20 to 1.96%.12371012 ) vai during posterior approach surgery has been incurred during the instrumentation phase , but vai during the posterior exposure or decompression phase is extremely rare . the management and subsequent outcome of patients with iatrogenic vai are controversial . in this paper , we report the endovascular embolization case of vai in posterior approach epidural tumor resection surgery . the purpose of this report is review the prevention and management of iatrogenic vai during cervical spine surgery . a 57-year - old man complained of left upper back ( scapular area ) pain for eight years . several kinds of conserva - tive therapies were done at local clinic , but they were ineffective . after cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) at another hospital , he had been diagnosed cervical neurogenic tumor and visited our hospital for tumor resection surgery . his neurological exam was without deficit and the pain is the only symptom he has . mri with gadolinium demonstrated a 2.4-cm lobulated enhancing mass with internal cystic change involving left epidural space and neural foramen at c2 - 3 level , and widening of bony intervertebral foramen . the mass compressed spinal cord without signal change and abutted to left va . in the vertebral angiographic computed tomography ( ct ) , there was no evidence of abnormal steno - occlusive lesion or anatomic variation , bilateral vertebral arteries . but left vertebral artery was pushed out to anterior lateral direction at c2 - 3 level by the tumor mass ( figure 1 ) . for the operative approach and resection , the patient was lying concorde position and his head was fixed with mayfield 3-pin head clamp . after subcutaneous tissue and paravertebral muscle were dissected , left partial hemilam - inectomy at c2 - 3 level was done . the tumor was exposured then , showing yellowish , soft mass with well defined , encapsulated , and mild bleeding tendency . , we use pituitary forceps in the direction of c2 - 3 left foramen . during the procedure , active pulsating massive bleeding occurred suddenly ( figure 2 ) . immediate gauze packing and manual compression were begun and fluid resuscitation and phenylephrine injection were done as well . maintaining perfusion and reducing the risk of posterior circulation ischemia were done through increasing mean blood pressure ( mbp ) range 90 to 100 mmhg . furthermore , we started mega - dose steroid therapy just as in case of cord injury . the patient was transferred to angiography room under endotracheal general anesthesia after temporary wound closure with gauze packing by assuring control hemorrhage , following 30 minutes manual compression . in angiographic findings of both vertebral arteriogram , left va was non - dominant in comparison with right one . at c2 - 3 level , left va was focally narrowed due to extrinsic compression and leakage through arterial perforation with pseudoaneurysm was seen . meanwhile , right va has dominancy enough to fill left va retrograde below c2 level . segmental embolization of left va directly below c2 level foraminal segment was done by using multiple pushable coil ( mwce-18 - 14 - 4-nester 2ea , mwce-18 - 14 - 3-nester 1ea ) . and then , we confirmed the interruption of antegrade flow on left va and retrograde filling up to left c2 level from right va as well , through each side final control angiogram ( figure 3 ) . finally , the patient return to operation room , and the temporally closed wound was reopened . the tumor was gross totally resected according to postoperative mri ( figure 4 ) and the final pathologic diagnosis was schwannoma . he discharged at eight days after surgery without any complication and had no complication at six - week - follow - up in outpatient department as well . vai is a rare but serious complication of cervical spine surgery . potential to cause massive bleeding , neurologic deficit , and even death . complications of vai are arteriovenous fistula , late - onset hemorrhage , pseudoaneurysm , thrombosis with embolic incidents , cerebral ischemia , stroke , and death . complete occlusion of the vessel makes immediate post op stage ischemia , and emboli may cause partially occlusion at later.17 ) referred from a survey of members of cervical spine research society , the group ( 141 surgeons ) found that the overall incidence of injury was 0.07% . and the outcome were 90% were without permanent harm ( to the patient ) , and 10% resulted in neurological injury or death.13 ) anyone can be faced with vai during cervical spine surgery , even an experienced surgeon . reported rates of vai in anterior cervical surgery were 0.2% to 0.5% and posterior c1 - 2 transarticular fixation for atlantoaxial instability were 0% to 8.2%.913151619 ) except in the case of screw instrumentation , vai during posterior approach is extremely rare . neo et al.15 ) did a retrospective survey of more than 5,600 operations , and refer to the one case of a c2 - 3 rosary - like dumbbell schwannoma resection through a posterior approach . in that case , however , bleeding was recurred when the same operation field was re - opened to resect the residual tumors , and finally controlled by the ligation of the va . in this case , we approached the tumor through posterior exposure as routine procedure and it enable safe removal of both intradural and epidural intraspinal tumor components . as is well known , the cervical paraspinal region is difficult to access anteriorly . because the anatomy of anterior approach is confined in the narrow operation field , adjacent numerous neurovascular structures such as va . however , some surgeons prefer the anterolateral approach for cervical schwannomas below c2 because the facet is preserved and the vertebral artery can be controlled early.20 ) for prevention of vai , it is very important that consider carefully preoperative imaging studies . it is very important to make the operation plan after confirming the position of the va , its relation to bony and surrounding structures , especially , tumor boarder line by ct angiography and enhanced mri . it was separated from the tumor capsule , that is , not encapsulation , but abutted only . hemorrhage should be locally controlled , immediate vertebrobasilar ischemia must be prevented , and cerebral embolic complications must be avoided.9 ) the anesthesiologist should be informed of the need for fluid resuscitation to maintain perfusion pressure to reduce the risk of posterior circulation ischemia.17 ) however there is no definite consensus of management . there is possibility of delayed hemorrhage , even if the bleeding controlled using hemostatic agents or gauze compression . the best treatment is primary repair , however it is hard to do practically in the situation of deep and narrow accessible field . ligation is one of other alternatives . before procedure , confirming the va dominancy and enough retrograde collateral flow by intraoperative angiography is essential . ligation of the va is associated with significant morbidities of cerebellar infarction , isolated cranial nerve paresis and hemiplegia , and a reported mortality was 12%.18 ) the only 6% to 26% of patients has equal diameter of both vas , and the left va is often larger than the right va.11 ) the va supply the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory and injury of dominant va with acute blood loss may lead to the medullary ischemia , even infarction . therefore , we did fluid resuscitation with volume loading and increase mbp target range 90 to 100 mmhg with phenylephrine injection as soon after vai . in fact , the infarction risk was low because the patient has right dominant va in pre - operative ct angiography and right dominant flow with retrograde filling from left va to c2 level , crucially , in intraoperative angiography ( figure . 3a ) . refer to previous studies , the purpose of angiography in vai is to find the vascular complications , to confirm sufficient collateral blood supply to the brain , and to determine the patency of a surgically repaired vessel or to detect any stenosis . furthermore , fistula or pseudoaneurysm can be occluded by use of endovascular procedure , such as embolization.45814 ) peng et al.17 ) recommended immediate con - ventional angiography when the vai was managed by tamponade only or direct repair . the surgeon can decide the appropriate procedure among ligation , embolization or vessel repair , whether a patient has patent collateral va or not . in the strict sense , our angiography and embolization are not totally intraoperative due to the spatial limitation of operation room . we transferred out the patient to the angiography room under the general anesthesia . in spite of immediate arrange of angiography room and endovascular team , it incurred the risk of patient transportation during operation , delayed decision making and operation time extension . after angiographic confirming the adequate retrograde contralateral circulation from right va , total occlusion of left va by trapping embolization was done , final control angiography of occluded and collateral vessel , also golfinos et al.9 ) remarked that the injured va can be totally occluded to prevent further complications . however , the possibility of later pseudoaneurysm formation can not be excluded . because rebleeding on days to years after surgery has been reported.6 ) we will follow up radiologic study in a year after surgery for rule out the delayed pseudoaneurysm growing and the tumor recurrence by ct vertebral angiography and enhanced mri . the patient has no symptom in last outpatient department visit at six weeks after surgery . the incidence of vai in cervical neurogenic tumor resection surgery is very rare , but it can happen to anyone . to prevent vai , when you encountered vai during operation , first do local bleeding control with compression , and check the perfusion maintenance to avert ischemia . treatment of choice is primary repair , and the alternative is endovascular embolization after intraoperative angiogram for verifying enough retrograde collateral flow . the situation happens unexpectedly , so it would be helpful to keep the procedure in mind .',\n",

dose intravenous steroid for 2 days , followed by oral prednisone 120  mg daily . when she started steroid taper , liver enzymes were elevated again . thus , she restarted high - dose intravenous steroid and mycophenolate 1000  mg twice a day . after 3 months of steroid taper , she was placed on a maintenance physiologic dose of steroid . the liver lesion remained stable until august of 2013 , when she had progression on positron emission tomography - computed tomography ( pet - ct ) ( figure 1 ) , for which she underwent a wedge resection with harvest of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in november of 2013 . a molecular analysis of the liver lesion revealed a gna11 mutation with wild -

it is less time consuming and economical ( 1 , 2 ) . tooth discoloration varies in etiology , appearance , location , and severity ( 3 ) . it could be classified as intrinsic , extrinsic , or both according to its location and etiology ( 4 ) . extrinsic discoloration is caused by chromogens derived from habitual intake of dietary sources such as wine , coffee , tea , carrots , oranges , chocolate , tobacco , mouth rinses , or plaque on the tooth surface ( 5 ) , while intrinsic discoloration typically results from systemic or local causes . systemic causes include drug - related ( tetracycline ) , metabolic , fluorosis , and genetic ( hyperbilirubinemia , amelogenesis imperfecta , and dentinogenesis imperfecta ) . local causes include pulp necrosis , intrapulpal hemorrhage , pulp tissue remnants after endodontic therapy , endodontic materials , coronal filling materials , root resorption , and aging ( 6 ) . over the years are oxalic acid , calcium hypochlorite , hydrogen peroxide , carbamide peroxide , and sodium perborate ( 2 ) . the most commonly used agents for bleaching endodontically treated teeth are 30%35% hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate either in combination or separately ( 7 ) . two basic techniques have been used to bleach discolored nonvital teeth : thermocatalytic and walking bleach . both methods have lost favor due to the potential risk , which includes cervical resorption , under- or over - lightening , the possibility of color regression , and external root resorption . recently , a variety of products and techniques have been developed to resolve or minimize the side effects of the bleaching process . this development has been paralleled with rising interest among patients in correcting esthetic problems with their dentition ( 8 , 9 ) . therefore , in the current study , many modifications have been done for bleaching techniques in an attempt to minimize the risk and side effects of the bleaching process . a 13-year - old boy , who complained of discolored and unaesthetic appearance of his upper central incisor , was selected from the pedodontic clinic in the shibin elkom teaching hospital ( egypt ) in june 2013 . the child was free from systemic disorders , and he was not under any medications that cause darkening or staining of the teeth . a diagnosis of nonvital maxillary right central incisor was made , based on the vitality test , which was performed by using an electric pulp tester ; thus , the shade guide of the discolored tooth was assessed under normal daylight with a vita porcelain shade guide ( vita zahafabrik ) ; also , a pre- and post - bleaching photograph was taken for the patient . conventional endodontic treatment was done for the patient , and , after successful endodontic treatment , the bleaching process was undertaken using 35% hydrogen peroxide gel . the gingiva was protected by water - soluble cream ( vaseline ) applied to soft tissues , and rubber dam isolation was achieved ; then , 12 mm of the gutta - percha was removed in an apical direction beyond the cemento - enamel junction . the tooth was then washed with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution , rinsed and dried . to assure a barrier between the sealed root canal and the bleaching gel ( mechanical seal ) , usa , union broach co. , long island city , ny ) was then expressed into the opened pulp chamber and on the labial surface , and curing light was applied to activate the bleaching gel from the labial and palatal sides ( 10 ) . then , the pulp chamber was rinsed and dried and obdurated with calcium hydroxide to be left in the pulp chamber for 1 week before the final or permanent filling material ( light cure composite resin ) ( 11 , 12 ) . clinical evaluation was recorded by comparing the tooth shade with its original one before treatment using the vita porcelain shade guide and photographs ; also , radiographic evaluation was done at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 9 month intervals by taking periodical radiographs for the patient using the paralleling technique . the automatically developed radiographs were digitized using a full color flatbed umax scanner ( umax data system , inc . usa ) with a transparency adapter connected to a standard ibm compatible personal computer having a pentium iii intel processor and a 15 in . the scanned images were saved in a 28 gigabyte hard disk in tagged image format files ( tiff ) with adobe photoshop version 5.5 ( adobe system incorporated , seattle , wa ) ( 13 ) . as shown in figure 1 , periapical radiographs were taken prior to bleaching of teeth , immediately after bleaching , and at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 9 months after bleaching . the pre - bleaching assessment for the tooth was diagnosed as having periapical pathosis ; during the follow - up period , there were signs of healing since the start of root canal treatment . the presence of resorption was also assessed radiographically using the digital subtraction technique ( 14 ) , and there was no evidence of cervical or progressive apical resorption ( figure 2 ) . the present study was undertaken to evaluate the trials made to minimize the side effects of bleaching agents ; hence , teeth bleaching is a harmless process , but some conditions have to be respected : correct and complete soft tissue isolation ( gums , lips , cheeks ) , in order to protect them from eventual burns caused by the peroxide . some modifications have been done in an attempt to minimize the risk of cervical or apical resorption ; thus , a base of 12 mm glass ionomer cement was placed over the root filling material to assure a mechanical barrier between the sealed root canal and the bleaching gel , which is in agreement with other studies ( 8 , 9 ) but is in disagreement with friedman et al . ( 15 ) , as they did not use an intermediate lining prior to the bleaching material . another modification added to the bleaching technique was that on reaching the desired shade guide ; thus , the pulp chamber was obturated by calcium hydroxide for seven days before the final filling material was placed . this was necessary to allow for elimination of residual oxygen , which interferes with the polymerization of the filling material and to neutralize and render the medium alkaline that reduces the risk of cervical resorption ( 16 ) . radiographic follow - up using digital subtraction technique showed no evidence of any cervical resorption or any progressive alteration in the periapical area around the tooth , which may be attributed to the placement of the mechanical seal that prevents the leakage of hydrogen peroxide ; hence , a reduced potential risk of invasive resorption was noted ( 17 ) . this case report demonstrates the successful management of a discolored nonvital tooth using 35% hydrogen peroxide gel ( opalescence xtra ) as bleaching material , effectively and safely , by following modifications and precautions to eliminate the side effects of peroxides . no evidence of cervical resorption of the tooth was observed during the follow - up period ; furthermore , there were signs of improvement related to the periapical region . more advanced studies still needed to gather more information about the stability of results and to detect any adverse effect that could appear .',\n",

( 8) , the rate was 87% for pcnl and 67% for rirs . in another study , success rates of 73.5% and 91.2% were achieved with one session rirs and pcnl , respectively ( 9 ) . in a retrospective study , knoll et al . compared rirs and mini - pcnl in treatment of 1 cm to 3 cm calculi in patients with solitary kidney . in their study , the calculi had almost similar size and more than half of them were located in the lower calyx . they reported that the rate of success following the first session was 96% in the mini - pcnl and 71.5% in the rirs groups ( 10 ) . according to the studies on pcnl complication , it has been found to be safe with acceptable complication rates in the patients with solitary kidney . in those studies , the rate of success was 77% and the rate of venous hemorrhage requiring transfusion was 7.3% ( 7 ) . pcnl was found to be safe in the patients with solitary kidney in the study by akman et al . ( 11 ) . although there are several publications in the literature that show a wide safety margin of pcnl in the patients with solitary kidney , unique complication of the procedure remains problematic . the most serious complication in the cases with solitary kidney is related to the arterial system . the most important issue in these complications is decision on how to diagnose the condition . ct gives valuable information in demonstrating the lesion during the early arterial phase of the complications . disadvantages of the procedure are use of contrast medium and difficulty of performing selective angiography at the time of diagnosis . magnetic resonance imaging enables more accurate diagnosis but nephrogenic fibrosis is an important complication ( 12 ) . selective renal angiography is the gold standard of diagnosis . the main advantage of selective renal angiography is possibility of performing simultaneous endovascular intervention ( 13 ) , which is the most appropriate treatment modality for arterial complications ( 14 ) . the procedure involves coil embolization of content of the pseudoaneurysm under guide of doppler us . important disadvantages of the procedure include arterial injury , intervention on one of the main segmental arteries , occurrence of hemorrhage to require nephrectomy ( all of which are unique complications of the intra - arterial intervention ) , use of contrast medium , and exposure to radiation . this method reduces the risk of partial or total nephrectomy due to hemorrhage especially in the patients with solitary kidney . the method is fast and effective , and may reduce mortality and morbidity by sparing the renal tissue . thus , it is recommended as first - line treatment for active hemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm in the kidney ( 15 ) . in the patient presented here , using contrast medium for conventional selective renal angiography posed cumulative risk because of development of serious arterial complication and consequent acute renal failure . doppler us and direct percutaneous embolization may be useful in treatment of arterial complications in the patients with solitary kidney . using heparin during hemodialysis for treatment of acute renal failure due to hemorrhage and hypotension in such patients determining and entering the accessory renal arteries under the guide of doppler us prior to scheduled pcnl may reduce arterial complications in the patients with solitary kidney . in conclusion , other endoscopic therapeutic methods , rirs , and mini - micro - pcnl are the alternative therapeutic modalities . in the case of arterial complication , direct percutaneous intervention under the guide of doppler us , however , is an alternative therapeutic method in terms of lowering complications .',\n",

       " {'article': 'the treatment options for the patient with variceal bleeding and portal hypertension have changed dramatically during the past decade . refinement in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies , and more recently , the development of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( tips ) led to a decreased number of patients treated with surgical shunt procedures .   however , selective porto - systemic shunting , especially distal splenorenal shunt ( dsrs ) can be considered for patients with relative preservation of hepatic function , this later is associated with decreased hepatic encephalopathy ( he ) and improved survival relative to less selective shunt . nevertheless , in the long term complications , he occurs in 9 - 15% , sometimes refractory to medical treatment .   in these cases , modifying porto - systemic shunts are the main therapeutic procedures .   we report the case of a man with persistent and severe he following dsrs treated with colectomy . a 59-year - old man , was diagnosed as having cirrhosis of unknown etiology since 1993 . there was neither iron overload , nor alcohol consumption , nor signs of metabolic syndrome . he had 3 episodes of esophageal bleeding between 1993 and 2003 treated successfully with sclerotherapy . the child - pugh score was a. in 2003 , he had an uncontrolled variceal bleeding refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy . , he had no recurrent variceal bleeding , no he and no ascitis . in 2010 , he developed a slight tremor of the upper extremities , predominating on the right , but he did not consult . one year later , he presented recurrent episodes of agitation , disorientation , amnesia , stupor and slurred speech . there was neither focal deficit , nor extra - pyramidal rigidity , nor muscular incoordination . biochemical analysis revealed normal glycemia and renal function , absence of severe liver dysfunction , no thyroidal disorders , no hypoxia . cerebral computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed no abnormalities whereas magnetic resonance ( mr ) disclosed hyperintensity of the globus pallidus on t1 ( figure 1 ) . abdominal doppler ultrasound and ct scan showed patency of the spleno - renal shunt , partial portal thrombosis , no signs of hepato - cellular carcinoma . a few weeks later , he presented recurrent episodes of gross disorientation , ideo - motor apraxia and loss of consciousness requiring repeated admissions in intensive care unit . the risk of rebleeding after reduction of the shunt was obvious , hepatic transplantation was not available , so we performed a subtotal colectomy with ileo - rectal anastomosis in order to reduce ammonia production . post - operative course was uneventful , in particular , no postoperative ascites and no need for transfusion . neurological examination disclosed normal consciousness , intellectual function and behavior while a slight tremor persisted in the right hand . ten days after the operation , the patient was able to be discharged home . in the follow - up , 17 months later , he was still improved , keeping only the slight tremor of the right hand , and liver function did not worsen . he did not have a recurrence of disorientation , intellectual function and behavior remained normal . he is a well recognized long term complication after a porto - systemic shunt , with a rate about 28% . the dsrs provides selective decompression of gastroesophageal varices , with maintenance of portal hypertension and hepatopetal flow . by preserving hepatopetal flow , however , its selectivity is neither uniform nor durable , and prevalence of he in the long term has been reported in 9 - 15% of cases . clinical manifestations may vary widely and there are several other differential diagnoses for the development of cognitive dysfunction in cirrhotics , especially intra - cranial events , electrolytes abnormalities and sepsis .   in some cases , neurological manifestations are unusual , as for our patient , because tremor was asymmetrical , we had to exclude other causes of focal neurological signs . the best option in patients with complex neurological manifestation is to exclude alternatives diagnoses , obtain a psychiatric and neurological consultation , and then perform mr imaging .   indeed , in he , deposition of paramagnetic substances in the basal ganglia causes a high signal intensity on t1 weighted imaging , characteristically at the globus pallidus , as for our patient . the absence of the t1 intensity in a patient with cirrhosis and neurological manifestations suggest that they are not related to he . for our patient , diagnosis of he was confirmed by mr and electroencephalogram which detected abnormalities characteristically present in he . many factors have been implicated in the development of he , including ammonia and other intestinal neurotoxins and alteration in neurotransmission . therefore , therapeutic options for he directed towards the reduction of ammonia production are the most commonly used , followed by action on neurotransmission and modifying porto - systemic collaterals .   particularly , in cases of chronic he postporto - systemic shunt , reduction or obliteration of the shunt by surgery or angiographic techniques are therapeutic options . in all cases , liver transplantation should be evaluated and remains the most radical therapy . however , colonic exclusion is a possibility reported earlier with good results in selected patients . as far back as the sixties , treatment of he by exclusion or total resection of the colon has already been successfully reported . while brief , other reports after the hepatic transplantation era showed similar good results . our patient had persistent he resistant to medical therapy , obliteration of the shunt was associated with an increased risk of rebleeding and liver transplantation was not available . notwithstanding , secondary bacterial colonization of the remaining intestine may lead to recurrence of increased ammonia levels . moreover , major abdominal surgery remains a challenge in patients with cirrhosis , associated with high morbidity and mortality rates , notably greater risk of bleeding , infection and ascites . in the mean time , it is known that portosystemic shunt , whether concomitant , whether preliminary , improves the prognosis of abdominal surgery in these patients . we believe that the portosystemic shunt and low child - pugh score of our patient may have facilitated surgery and improved post - operative outcome . finally , at this present time , 17 months after colectomy , we can think that colonic exclusion is an option to consider for the management of he refractory to medical therapy in child - pugh a cirrhosis in the absence of liver transplantation or as a bridge to transplantation given the long waiting time on lists . colonic exclusion should be considered as an option in the management of he refractory to medical treatment in highly selected patients , when liver transplantation is unavailable or delayed due to long waiting lists .',\n",

nevertheless , depending on the size and the shape of foreign body , the materials , and the characteristics of the patient , the foreign body may be detected in an unexpected area or pathway . we experienced a case in which an intrauterine contraceptive device ( iud ) was detected in the descending colon by abdominal x - ray , abdominal computed tomography , and colonoscopy and was treated by surgically by using a laparatomy . a 42-year - old female patient was admitted for pain in the lower abdomen that had started three months earlier . she had no special past history or social history and had been pregnant four times and delivered twice . five years earlier , an iud had been inserted at a private clinic , and no special symptoms were detected . from 3 months prior to admission , she had complained of vague lower left abdominal pain . in regard to vital signs at the time of admission , her blood pressure was 120/80 mmhg , her pulse was 70 times / minute , her respiration rate was 20 times / minute , and her body temperature was 36.6. she was conscious , with injected conjunctiva , icteric sclera , a skin rash , an oral ulcer , and dehydration of the tongue ; no other abnormal findings were detected . in abdominal examination , tenderness was felt in the lower left abdominal area ; nonetheless , rebound tenderness was not detected . in the musculoskeletal system , abnormal findings were not detected . on the peripheral blood test , leucocytes were 10,000/mm ( neurtophils , 83% ) , hemoglobin was 13.1 g / dl , and hematocrits were 39.3% . on the serum biochemistry test , total protein was 7.5 g / dl , albumin was 4.4 g / dl , serum cholesterol was 232 mg / dl , ast was 15 u / l , alt was 13 u / l , ldh was 347 u / l , alp was 130 u / l , r - gtp was 21 u / l , na was 138 meq / l , and k was 3.4 meq / l . during radiological tests , a foreign body in the abdominal cavity was detected by simple abdominal x - ray ( fig . the presence of a v - shaped substance in the vicinity of the descending colon was observed ( fig . 2 ) . subsequently , to confirm and remove the foreign body , a colonoscopic test was performed , and in the descending colon , 40 cm away from the anal verge , an iud that had penetrated the barrier and protruded into the lumen by approximately 3 - 4 cm was detected ( fig . endoscopic foreign body removal was attempted , but the iud could not be removed readily , and the patient presented with severe pain ;

thus , if compression necrosis of the intestinal wall progresses , an intestinal perforation , an intestinal fistula , or an abscess within the abdominal cavity may form . in addition , in cases in which the foreign object is fixed in a specific area and spontaneous expel is delayed , the possibility of developing complications is high , so it should be removed immediately , regardless of symptoms [ 1 , 2 ] . the iud is simple and safe and can be used effectively without spontaneous expulsion so that continuous contraception is obtained ; hence , it is used by approximately 160,000,000 women worldwide . the iud has been associated with such complications as hemorrhage , pain , pregnancy , spontaneous expulsion , uterine perforation , infection , and translocation in adjacent organs . migration of an iud from the uterus to other organs can be considered to be the result of expulsion of the iud and uterine perforation . the expulsion of the device is a complication reported rarely , and risk factors are past history of expulsion , dysmenorrhea , and young age . diverse symptoms from asymptomatic to vaginal bleeding , pelvic pain , and dyspareunia may be shown , and if the string of the device is not shown , it must be differentiated by using simple abdominal imaging and vaginal ultrasonography . uterine perforation by an iud is as rare as 0.87 in 1,000 person ; nonetheless , it is one of most dangerous complications [ 5 , 6 ] , and it may invade adjacent organs , the small intestine , the sigmoid colon , the cecum , and the appendix . although the incidence of uterine perforation and translocation within the abdominal cavity is low , it is a serious complication that has been reported in korea several times . our patient , however , had an iud that had perforated the descending colon , and until now , such cases have not been reported . if a foreign body is fixated in the intestine without changing , its endoscopic removal should be attempted , and if such methods fail , surgical removal should be performed . in our case , similarly , attempts were made to remove the iud by using colonoscopic procedures , but the patient presented with severe pain ; thus , the iud was removed by a resection of the colon . in cases with a foreign body within the intestinal tract for which the symptoms are similar to those of an acute abdomen and in cases associated with complications such as peritonitis , abscess , and fistula caused by intestinal perforation , the general method is to remove the foreign body by using a surgical laparotomy and to treat complications . particularly , for cases showing abdominal pain , fever , intermittent diarrhea , considering the damage to the intestines , it must be removed [ 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 ] . therefore , if patients with a past history of an iud develop symptoms of vague pain in the abdomen , vaginal hemorrhage , and dyspareunia , considering the possibility of expulsion of the device or uterine perforation , in addition to the basic history taking and physical examination , aggressive diagnosis by imaging medical tests is required . in conclusion , foreign bodies within the gastrointestinal tract are spontaneously expelled in most cases ; nonetheless , if sharp and hard substances are fixated in the intestinal tract and are not expelled , thus inducing diverse complications , it is best to remove them rapidly . if the initial removal of the foreign bodies immobilized in the intestine fails , surgical removal should be performed prior to the development of other complications .',\n",

enhancing lesion of 1.6 cm in the posterior aspect of the 4th lumbar vertebral column without spinal canal compression ( fig . 1 ) . to preserve right lower leg , debulking surgery of the recurrent lesion was performed , and the histological features were found to be consistent with recurrent sarcoma with rhabomyosarcomatous differentiation . two weeks after the surgery , the patient started to receive chemotherapy with a vac regimen composed of vincristine ( 1.5 mg / m ) , dactinomycin ( 0.045 mg / kg ) , and cyclophosphamide ( 2.2 g / m ) for a total of 44 weeks treatment course . given the potential risk of spinal pathologic fracture and myelopathy , radiotherapy was chosen to treat the 4th lumbar vertebral metastatic lesion . cyberknife hypofractionated radiotherapy was decided due to the solitary nature of the metastasis and fewer sessions are needed , which would decrease the frequency of general anesthesia for radiotherapy . the patient was immobilized in a vacuum mattress . fused enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) ( accuray ) and mri scans were used in the treatment planning . the delineation of the gross tumor volume ( gtv ) and the organs at risk was carried out on the planning ct . given the potential risk of kyphosis and scoliosis by asymmetric irradiation of the spine , the whole involved vertebra was contoured as the gtv . clinical target volume was equal to the gtv and no margin was added to obtain the planning target volume ( ptv ) , which was 8.84 ml . a total of 26 gy was prescribed to the 75% isodose line , covering 92.64% of the ptv with a maximal spinal cord dose of 744.26 cgy ( fig . cyberknife stereotactic body radiotherapy was performed on the 15th , 16th , 19th , and 20th of october 2009 with a mean procedure time of 83 min ( range 56 min to 128 min ) . the radiotherapy course was conducted in a manner concomitant with the first cycle of chemotherapy . during the radiotherapy , immobilization was aided by general anesthesia , and x - sight spine tracking ( accuray inc . ) was used to minimize setup error . up to the date of this report , i.e. , 33 months after radiotherapy , the patient remains neurologically stable and 23% reduction in tumor volume was achieved on the surveillance mri scans ( fig . in contrast with adult patients , there is no established consensus about the best management of spinal metastasis in children . sinha et al.16 ) presented a retrospective study of 20 children with metastatic spinal disease receiving various treatments including surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy and multi - modality combination therapy , and concluded that a standard treatment could not be established for metastatic tumor . conventional radiotherapy is established as an effective modality for spinal tumors10,15 ) . however , for durable tumor control and in cases of more radio - resistant malignancies , higher - dose radiotherapy may be needed and the radiotherapy is usually precluded by the radiosensitivity of the spinal cord or previous radiation4 ) . peugniez et al.13 ) reported the application of conventionally fractionated cyberknife radiotherapy ( 1.8 gy / fraction ) with 25.2 gy and 19.8 gy , respectively , in 2 children with recurrent spinal tumor after prior radiotherapy . however , the disease progressed despite the re - irradiation which indicates that conventional radiotherapy may not be efficient for children spinal metastatic tumor . the present case report describes a successful treatment protocol for spinal metastasis combining chemotherapy and high - precision cyberknife stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy for children diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma . the appropriate dose regimen for spinal radiotherapy for spinal metastasis depends on the primary cancer biology and other factors including tumor location , previous radiotherapy and surrounding critical organs , especially the spinal cord . however , the notable increase in the overall duration of treatment in conventional fractionated radiotherapy hinders the usefulness of radiotherapy in children due to the need for anesthesia during radiotherapy . in contrast to conventional radiotherapy schemes , hypofractionated radiotherapy is attractive because the dose is delivered over a few days and decreases the complexity of the treatment . a variety of fractionation schemes have been used in adult spinal stereotactic radiotherapy with fraction doses ranging from 6 to 30 gy in 1 to 5 fractions , and rare severe radiation dose - related myelopathy was identified in this range1,5,6 ) . nevertheless , the tolerability and feasibility of hypofractionated radiotherapy in children is rarely reported and limited to pediatric cns tumors7,8 ) . to our knowledge , this is the first report of cyberknife stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy in childhood spinal metastasis . each radiation schedule can be converted to biologically effective doses ( beds ) using the following formula and are compared on the same scale , where n is the number of fractions ; d , the dose per fraction ; and / , the alpha beta ratio for irradiated tissue with the bed for spinal cord being 3 ( bed3)9 ) .   gibbs et al.6 ) reported that limiting the volume of spinal cord treated above a bed3 of 29 gy to less than 1 ml may decrease the occurrence of radiation - induced myelopathy . however , information from the literature about the tolerance dose for the spinal cord in children is sparse , motivating us to reduce the dose limit by about 50% , i.e. , 14.5 gy in our case . the dose we choose for this patient was 26 gy in 4 fractions , with the maximal spinal cord bed3 around 12 gy and a good coverage of 92.64% . with this dose fraction , no severe adverse events was noted during and after treatment over the ongoing period of 33 months . this is the first report of cyberknife stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy for infantile fibrosarcoma with spinal metastasis . at 33-month follow - up , the patient was still neurologically stable and showed partial response with no acute radiation toxicity . however , further clinical experiences and longer follow - up are needed to determine the efficiency and safety of cyberknife hypofractionated radiotherapy in childhood spinal metastatic disease .',\n",

twenties ( average : 23 mmhg ) . eight weeks after an acrylic intraocular lens implantation by corneoscleral incision , the tafluprost treatment was resumed . ten weeks after the surgery , the tafluprost treatment was discontinued , and travoprost treatment was initiated . thirteen weeks after the surgery , the patient complained of a reduction in visual acuity ( 20/40 ) . cme was identified in the right eye by optical coherence tomography ( oct ) findings ( figure 1a ) , and was treated with an injection of subtenon triamcinolone . discontinuance of travoprost and the initiation of diclofenac eye drops improved the visual acuity ( 20/20 ) and resulted in a rapid improvement in the oct findings within a few days ( figure 1b ) . after 3 months , travoprost was resumed and diclofenac was discontinued 6 months after surgery . no recurrence has occurred for a period of 2 years ( figure 1c ) , and the iop has been controlled at 1619 mmhg . in 2004 , the patient underwent intraocular lens suture surgery , including anterior vitreous cutting , for intraocular lens dislocation in his left eye . the patient had been treated with latanoprost prior to the surgery , and treatment with latanoprost was continued after it . however , the patient complained of blurred vision early in july 2007 . on august 1 , his visual acuity was 20/200 , and the oct findings indicated cme ( figure 2a ) . his visual acuity had recovered to 20/40 , and the oct findings showed improvement ( figure 2b ) . no recurrence of the cme has occurred for a period of 3 years , and iop has been controlled at 1015 mmhg ( figure 2c ) . risk factors for cme due to prostaglandin eye drops include a surgical history of glaucoma operations , aphakia , complicated cataract surgery , scleral buckling , and vitrectomy , as well as a history of uveitis and other retinal diseases . patients without risk factors for developing the condition are rare.17 in terms of the prevalence of cme , wand et al reported that two of 38 high - risk cases ( 5.3% ) developed clinical cme.4 meanwhile , furuichi et al found that none of the 68 cases without any of the reported risk factors developed clinical cme.11 in cases without known risk factors , cme can appear within 23 months of surgery.10,12 meanwhile , in high - risk cases , cme can even appear several years after the surgery.1,35,7,13 in cases without the known risk factors for cme , the condition may develop because of temporary damage to the blood  aqueous barrier is protracted , resulting in the continuance of conditions that lead to cme in the long term.14 case one presented cme while undergoing benzalkonium chloride - free travoprost treatment . miyake et al reported that preservatives in the prostaglandin eye drops have a greater influence on the development of cme when compared to the base compound.15 additionally , watanabe et al reported cme cases that developed when latanoprost treatment was initiated after 3 years of treatment with preservative - containing unoprostone.7 cme has similarly been reported when latanoprost was added to a drug regimen that already included several types of eye drops containing preservatives.24 while preservatives may promote latanoprost - induced cme , the preservatives alone do not provide a sufficient explanation for the development of this condition . esquenazi studied a case of cme induced by benzalkonium chloride - free travoprost.9 in case one of this study , benzalkonium chloride - free travoprost appears to be the cause of the cme . no other eye drops were used during the treatment , and the patient had no underlying diseases ( eg , diabetes ) that could have caused cme . because the risk of cme is high immediately after cataract surgery , nsaids should be used along with a prostaglandin eye liquid.16 in case one , the administration of diclofenac was discontinued 6 months after surgery since it was determined that the danger of developing cme had decreased , although the treatment with travoprost was continued . no recurrence has been observed for a period of 2 years . in case two , treatment with the diclofenac eye drops and latanoprost was continued because it was believed that the damage to the blood  aqueous barrier would be protracted . wand and gaudio reported two cases in which cme treated with nsaids did not recur after unoprostone and bimatoprost treatment was resumed.13 further , this group reported one case in which cme did not recur after latanoprost treatment was resumed.4 meanwhile , callanan et al reported one case in which cme not treated with nsaids recurred after resumption of latanoprost treatment.3 prostaglandin has no systemic side effects and is currently the most effective drug as an eye liquid . when possible , the use of this drug should be resumed after a certain period of time . in certain cases , the concomitant use of nsaids and prostaglandin eye drops can be greatly beneficial to patients . subtenon injection of triamcinolone is considered the standard treatment for cme caused by diabetic retinopathy , retinal vein occlusion , uveitis , or other conditions . however , no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of this treatment for cme caused by the use of prostaglandin eye drops . several treatment options are available for prostaglandin - induced cme , including nsaids , steroids , dorzolamide hydrochloride eye drops , and oral acetazolamide ; however , in many cases , recovery can take as long as 1 month or more.36,810 triamcinolone treatment poses the risk of the typical side effects caused by steroids , but the risk of infection should not be a concern if its usage is avoided immediately after the surgery . case one had no surgical complications and presented cme during the use of travoprost ; therefore , aggressive care was chosen . case two presented blindness in the right eye , and there was a strong desire for a quick recovery of the left eye . the authors believe that in such a case , subtenon triamcinolone injection is the selectable course of treatment . subtenon triamcinolone injection can be effective for cme after cataract surgery . moreover , the current findings suggest that the prostaglandin eye drops that potentially led to the cme can be resumed under careful observation .',\n",

though radiation achieved a complete metabolic response of a very short duration . another notable unusual feature was , that pet - ct after completion of treatment showed complete metabolic remission suggesting a possibility longer disease free survival contrary to that patient developed local relapse and distant failure in a very short period of time . although , negative predictive value of pet - ct is reported to be 90% in literature the probability of missing residual disease , which recurred after a short interval of 1 year can not be ignored . hence , development of better follows - up strategies including introspection of ( fludeoxyglucose ) fdg - pet to identify the relapse are required . the recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy in pms has been rarely associated with malignant transformations to sarcomas . the exclusion of such an event would have been desirous with biopsy and imunohistochemistry marker but was excluded as per patient wishes and socio - economic issues . although , the results of the second line chemotherapy especially with high - dose regimens with stem cell rescue have been encouraging in the literature recently ; but were again excluded after considering patient and disease factors . the most important aspect from clinical profile of this patient includes unusual sites of metastasis at the time of recurrence . despite the finding that soft - tissue comprises approximately 55% of our body mass , hematogenous metastases to these areas direct extension of a primary tumor to soft- tissue is a much more common event than distant soft - tissue metastases . autopsy studies have also addressed the incidence of secondary malignancies involving soft - tissue sites . one of the large autyopsy series concluded that secondary tumors were actually much more common than primary malignant tumors of soft - tissue . analyzed total 118 cases of soft - tissue metastasis , in 27.11% of cases the metastasis to soft - tissue was the initial manifestation of the disease leading to the subsequent identification of the primary tumor elsewhere . most commonly reported malignancies resulting in distant soft - tissue metastases are lung , kidney , and colon carcinoma . six patients with primary testicular malignancy have been described in literature with soft - tissue metastasis . four had seminoma histology with most common sites of deposits in the abdominal wall , back , thigh , chest , and shoulder . in all the four patients , these metastases were present at the time of recurrence . this is the first report where pms had metastasis at soft - tissue , also cheek as the site of metastasis has never been described before in association with pms . until now , only three patients of pms with bone metastasis at presentation have been described in the literature . hence soft - tissue and bone metastasis together at relapse in pms with a short disease free interval is a rare previously unreported clinical entity . the metastasis at both sites were unresponsive to radiotherapy is also quite unusual for seminomas . the 5 - 10% of all seminomas is anaplastic histology associated with increased frequency of metastasis and locally advanced stage . although 30% of patients who die from seminoma have anaplastic morphology but stage - to - stage , treatment outcomes for patients with classic versus the expression of genes ( dopamine receptor d1 and family with sequence similarity 71 , member f2 ( fam71f2 ) and microsatellite instability have been associated with chemoresistance and increased metastatic seminoma . however , whether the pms have the similar genes pre - disposing to chemoresistance and aggressive spread to unusual sites is unknown . the present case indicates that such patients are prone for early relapse and routine follow - up strategies like serum markers and conventional ct scans at a regular interval may be inadequate . treatment strategies like imatinib in metastatic seminoma and other targeted agents have recently shown promise . to summarize this is a rare case of pms with earlier age of presentation with features of svco . the poor response to platinum based chemotherapy is uncommon and a poor prognostic marker although there was a complete  metabolic and biochemical response  post - chemo - radiotherapy . genetic markers predisposing to aggressive behavior , chemo / radio resistance , early relapse , and unusual sites of metastasis should be identified . such patients although rare must be identified for improved treatment modalities and follow - up strategies to detect recurrences and metastasis early .',\n",

associated jaundice [ 4 , 5 ] our experience suggests that a thorough workup to exclude secondary causes such as gallstones and malignancy is mandatory . she complained of chronic dull pain , satiety , weight loss , dyspnea and physical disability . the patient had had clay - coloured stools and dark urine the last two weeks before admission . physical examination revealed a large non - tender abdominal mass and no signs of chronic liver disease such as splenomegaly or ascites . liver function tests were compatible with obstructive jaundice , with total bilirubin 8.07 mg / dl ( normal range < 1 mg / dl ) , with direct predominance ( 7.51 mg / dl ) and elevation of alkaline phosphatase ( 337 u / l , normal range 50136u / l ) and -gt ( 404 u / l , normal range 1585 u / l ) . ca19 - 9 value was 224 u / ml ( normal range 037 u / ml ) . ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed multiple liver cysts ranging from 1.2 to 13 cm in diameter and dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts . computed tomography ( ct ) scan was performed using the standard protocol for hepatobiliary disease evaluation ( slice thickness 35 mm , arterial - portal venous and delayed phases after contrast administration ) . percutaneous drainage of the hilar cysts was performed to confirm that subsequent fenestration or enucleation will resolve jaundice . however the persistence of cholestasis and the mild dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts in the post drainage ct evaluation ( fig . the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( mri - mrcp ) that was compatible with the presence of possible neoplasmatic infiltration at the distal common bile duct , since duct compression was not marked enough to justify intrahepatic biliary dilatation and furthermore the distal segment of the common bile duct was not evident ( fig . the abrupt termination of the middle segment of the common bile duct was indicative of neoplastic infiltration . the postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 9th postoperative day . at six - month follow - up autosomal dominant polycystic disease is genetically heterogeneous , with mutations in two distinct genes predisposing to the combination of renal and liver cysts ( ad - pkd1 and ad - pkd2 ) . furthermore , davila et al .   reported a second gene ( sec6 ) related to pld . the disease is more frequent in women , and hepatic cysts can increase dramatically in number and size through the child - bearing years of early and middle adult life . the cysts in pld can also increase in size and number during pregnancy or simultaneously with the use of exogenous female steroid hormones . in one study it was shown that the use of estrogen in women with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease may selectively increase the severity of hepatic cystic disease . usually patients suffer from chronic dull abdominal pain , satiety , weight loss , dyspnea , physical disability and descensus . jaundice may rarely exist due to compression of the common bile duct by the cysts . in our experience , including this case , obstructive jaundice is usually associated with a co - existing underlying pathology such as gallstone disease or malignancy . in pld , liver failure or complications of advanced liver disease are rare . even with marked hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension , liver function is well preserved . thus jaundice is uncommon and requires further exploration to exclude benign or malignant disease . in our case other authors have reported co - existing choledocholithiasis and other complications of pld causing obstructive jaundice . in case of jaundice , standard pre and post contrast mri sequences are necessary to establish the presence of an underlying malignancy that may be suggested by the biliary dilatation seen at mrcp . mrcp is also helpful to estimate the intraductal extent of tumor infiltration , facilitating surgical planning . ercp can also help to confirm the cause of jaundice , presenting the further advantage of performing brushing or biopsy . the presence of the cholangiocarcinoma in the distal common bile duct , as was shown on imaging in our case , led the surgical team to perform a successful pylorus - preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with dominant liver cysts enucleation , which was considered the best therapeutic option for the patient . cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy of the bile ducts and accounts for 1550% of obstructing bile duct tumors . factors that predispose to the development of cholangiocarcinoma include ulcerative colitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , choledochal cysts , caroli disease , polyposis syndromes of the colon and clonorchis sinensis infestation . cholangiocacinomas are generally classified as intrahepatic ( peripheral ) lesions , hilar lesions , and distal ductal tumors . if no tumor mass is seen , diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma can be made by the presence of high - grade intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and the absence of right and left hepatic duct union . if the neoplasm is located at a lower level , as in our case , at the point of obstuction the duct will terminate abruptly or there may be associated eccentric thickening of bile duct wall [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] . the reason of the nonvisibility of the cholangiocarcinoma on ct images in our patient could be attributed to cyst superimposition obscuring the lesion and to the infiltrative type of the neoplasm , as was proven on histopathology , characterized by the absence of tumor mass . mrcp is essential for the accurate estimation of obstruction level and the depiction of the characteristic morphologic features of stenosis or obstruction ( abrupt termination of the bile duct as in our case ) . because of their intrinsic high tissue contrast and multiplanar capability , mri and mrcp are able to detect and preoperatively assess patients with cholangiocarcinoma , investigating all involved structures such as bile ducts , vessels and hepatic parenchyma . the main reason for surgical / imaging discrepancy is represented by the microscopic diffusion along the mucosa and in the perineural space . it should also be emphasized that the presence of multiple cystic liver lesions superimposed on the biliary ducts , displacing or distorting them , may obscure the presence of a cholangiocarcinoma . on the other hand , false - negative results are also encountered with ercp washing or brushing in some patients due to the submucosal tumor growth . intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurs rarely in patients with multiple liver cysts and tumor origin from cysts after in situ transformation of the epithelium has been shown in some cases [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ] . the prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma associated with pld is very poor and distant metastases are common . the possibility of cholangiocarcinoma should be considered in any patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with significant abnormal liver function tests . after extensive review of the literature , it appears that coexistence of pld with distal common bile duct cholangiocarcinoma as in our case has not been reported so far . these consist of cyst hemorrhage , rupture , infection , uterine prolapse due to displacement , obstructive jaundice , portal hypertension , transudative and exudative ascites and budd - chiari syndrome [ 19 , 20 ] . surgery is indicated in most cases , as medical treatment has failed to show any efficacy . use of somatostatin to block the secretin - induced secretion by hepatic cysts failed to demonstrate any significant effect on hepatic cyst growth size . cyst aspiration with sclerosis , open or laparoscopic cyst fenestration , combined hepatic resection and fenestration or liver transplantation are possible treatment options . aspiration combined with ethanol instillation to induce sclerosis of the cyst lining epithelium can be effective in patients with a few dominant cysts ( type i pld  few large cysts > 7 cm ) . cyst fenestration can be performed in patients with more diffuse pld ( type ii pld  patients with small cysts throughout the liver have a greater risk of persistence and recurrence of symptoms . combined hepatic resection and fenestration is more effective in reducing the hepatic mass and gastric compression . recurrence rates vary significantly in the literature with high postoperative morbidity rates ( 38100% ) . this procedure offers an additional advantage in the case of massive hepatomegaly and severe symptoms of gastric compression . resection addresses the problem of liver mass , but poses a significant risk of biliary ductal injury , vascular compromise , and liver insufficiency because cysts markedly distort the intrahepatic anatomy . postoperative morbidity is related to the presence of temporary ascites , pleural effusion and biliary leakage . in particular , ascites has been troublesome due to continued cyst secretion from residual fenestrated cysts , disruption of intrahepatic lymphatics and partial venous outflow obstruction . candidates for combined resection / fenestration should have at least two adjacent liver segments not involved by cysts and normal liver function . these patients should be also managed by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons at institutions with advanced intensive care and interventional radiological and gastroenterology support . liver transplantation has been performed in rare cases when the above - mentioned interventions were not an option . in patients who harbour diffuse pld , orthotopic liver transplantation is effective , but inherently assumes the risks of long - term immunosuppression and rejection . orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated for patients with progressive pld after resection / fenestration , patients with concurrent liver dysfunction and renal failure , and patients with diffuse pld without segmental sparing . jaundice presents infrequently in this group of patients , unless a secondary cause exists . in such situations a thorough diagnostic workup is mandatory to exclude the coincidence of benign or malignant disease .',\n",

       " {'article': \"for early - stage tracheal cancer , high - dose - rate endobronchial brachytherapy ( hdr - ebt ) can be a treatment choice as a boost for external beam radiotherapy ( ebrt ) or as a definitive therapy [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . high - dose - rate endobronchial brachytherapy is also used successfully as a palliative treatment for symptomatic airway obstruction by malignant tumors [ 4 , 5 ] . however , in some cases with longer follow - up , hdr - ebt leads to severe complications , which are sometimes lethal , such as radiation - induced bronchitis , bronchial stenosis , and fetal hemoptysis [ 6 , 7 ] . although these complications might reflect the high - dose region resulted from the small distance between the applicator and tracheobronchial mucosa , further investigation is needed on how high - dose volume topographically correlates with the location of late radiation injury . however , there exists technical challenge because the location of small high - dose volumes in fractionated radiotherapy can be affected by intra- and inter - fractional organ motion , and the anatomical features of an organ post - treatment will be different from those pre - treatment due to the sequelae of radiation treatment . for the purpose of spatiotemporal dose assessment of hdr - ebt in combination with ebrt , one important technique is non - rigid image registration , which enables the estimation of dose summation based on the corresponding structures across the image data sets . previously , we have demonstrated an image - processing framework using surface - based , non - rigid registration for assessing the spatially cumulative dose in consecutive brachytherapy treatments . the core of our approach is based on the point set registration using a gaussian mixture model ( gmm - reg ) , which was originally introduced by jian and vemuri . because gmm - reg demonstrated the biomechanically natural registration with high accuracy and validity , we considered that it can be a plausible technique for transforming planned dose distribution to the post - treatment organ . here , we present a case of tracheobronchial radiation stenosis after the definitive therapy using hdr - ebt and ebrt for early - stage tracheal cancer . by using the proposed dose reconstruction technique , the spatial association between the dosimetric profile and the site of the radiation morbidity with a severe tracheobronchial stenosis was evaluated . a 78-year - old man developed a second primary tracheal cancer 5 years after a right lower lobectomy for early stage lung carcinoma . bronchoscopy revealed a tumor localized at the left lateral wall of the middle part of the trachea and histology confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma . the patient was then treated with hdr - ebt ( 24 gy in 6 gy fractions ) followed by ebrt ( 40 gy in 2 gy fractions ) with a curative intent . follow - up bronchoscopies revealed a patent airway with granulomatous mucositis for 1 year after the treatment , with no evidence of biopsy - proven malignancy . twenty - four months after the treatment , at the age of 80 , the patient was admitted to our department because of progressive dyspnea . computed tomography ( ct ) detected a tracheobronchial stenosis with aspiration pneumonia of the right lung . massive pneumonia infiltrated the right lung completely due to the stenosis of the right primary bronchus . bronchoscopy revealed that the surface of the tracheal mucosa was irregular with inflammation , and bled easily on contact . it also revealed a small ulcer above the circumferential tracheal stenosis . because the tissue examination of the tracheal mucosa was consistently negative for malignancy before the admission , we diagnosed late radiation - induced mucositis with severe circumferential stenosis . our hdr - ebt treatment protocol has been described in detail elsewhere . in short , a 12 fr malecot - type catheter with two wings was placed from the middle part of the trachea to the right primary bronchi during bronchoscopy under local anesthesia . based on the ct images with 2 mm slice thickness , treatment planning was done on oncentra ( nucletron , an elekta company , elekta ab , stockholm , sweden ) . high -

rigid registration , which added a penalty term to the final cost function to control the strength of regularization . therefore , the registration method between the model set m and the scene set s finds the warping function u of the tps function , which minimizes the following cost function in the presence of the weight parameter  for the bending energy : e={gmm(s)-gmm(u(m))}2dx+bending(u ) \\n  the process was driven by a numerical optimization algorithm called the annealing step to minimize local minima . the transformation parameters of each step was as follows:(1,2,3,4,5)=(0.6,0.3,0.1,0.05,0.02),(1,2,3,4,5)=(1.0,1.010 -

treatment tracheobronchial stenosis . for expressing the equivalent dose in a fractional dose of 2 gy ( eqd2 ) in hdr - ebt , / of a linear quadratic model was assumed as 3 gy for tracheobronchial mucosa . to measure the geometric accuracy of the transformation , surface distance error ( sde ) and surface coverage error ( sce ) surface distance error was defined as the mean distance between the transformed points and the fixed surface . surface coverage error represented the coverage of the fixed surface by the transformed points and was derived by calculating the standard deviation ( sd ) of the distances from each vertex of the fixed structure to the nearest transformed point . transformation with small sde and small sce indicated a high geometric accuracy . for accessing the homogeneity of the dose distribution , we calculated the homogeneity index ( hi ) as follows : where d \\n max is the maximum point dose to the inner surface of the tracheal bronchus and d \\n p is the prescribed dose . to quantify the severity of the stenosis , the luminal area of the tracheobronchial stenosis was evaluated as an intersection between the tracheobronchial surface and the plane , which was orthogonal to the principal axis of the organ . the principal axis was obtained using principal component analysis for the points on the structure surface . each corresponding plane was computed based on the deformation fields for each tracheal bronchus at the time of treatment planning ( the 1 to 4 fraction of hdr -

treatment tracheobronchial structure . the relationship between the local dose and the ratio of luminal areas [ the ratio = post - treatment luminal areapre - treatment luminal area ] was calculated from the level of the plane 100 mm above the first carina ( inferiorly ) to the plane just below the glottis ( superiorly ) . spearman 's rank correlation coefficient was calculated for the association between the irradiated dose and the ratio of luminal areas . statistical significance was set at a two - sided p - value of less than 0.05 . the dose - response relationship between irradiated local dose and severity of the stenosis was quantitatively evaluated . a ) the luminal area of the tracheobronchial stenosis was computed as the intersectional area between the surface and the plane orthogonal to the principal axis of the organ subvolume . the corresponding intersectional area of each pre -

ebt varied unevenly from fraction to fraction ( hi = 3.7  0.2 ) . unexpected hot spots irradiated by more than 20 gy per fraction resulted from the small distance between the catheter and the tracheobronchial inner surface ( figure 4 ) , as the minimum distance between them was 2.4  1.1 mm for the four fractions of hdr -

dose volume and the site of late radiation injury represented by tracheobronchial stenosis . although the post - treatment tracheobronchial surface showed a large anatomical deformation , the measured low - distance error implies that the proposed approach with gmm - reg successfully registered the structures . as a result , the estimated cumulative local dose on the tracheobronchial surface significantly corresponded with the severity of radiation stenosis . the present study is of importance because the surface - based , non - rigid registration can be a core of the technique to predict the location - by - location difference in the severity of late radiation injury . while there is variation in dose - fractionation regimens and treatment intentions among previous studies , the crude incidence of symptomatic radiation - induced bronchitis is 4 - 12% in hdr - ebt with ebrt [ 7 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ] . speiser and spratling proposed a grading system to classify radiation - induced bronchitis , which ranges from mild mucosal inflammatory response with swelling ( grade 1 ) to major fibrosis with circumferential stenosis ( grade 4 ) . according to the grading scale , our presented case represented the most severe phase of grade 4 radiation tracheobronchitis in small regions , which were cumulatively irradiated by more than 200 gy3 . severe inflammatory response with mild fibrosis of the tracheobronchial wall , which corresponds to grade 3 , was apparently associated with mucosa irradiated by more than 100 gy3 . it is necessary for radiation oncologists to avoid excessive irradiation to the tracheobronchial mucosa because once radiation - induced tracheobronchitis becomes progressive , it never heals spontaneously , and often develops into fatal hemoptysis . for the present case , we prescribed a dose of 6 gy at 1 cm from the catheter without enough spatial consideration of the distance from the tracheobronchial surface ; thus there have been few reports on the spatial correspondence between high - dose volume and the site of radiation injury . by using rectosigmoidoscopy and rectal morbidity assessment , georg et al . although they emphasized the clinical relevance of dvh parameters , such as d2cc , d1cc , and d0.1cc , it might be an alternative approach to focus on the surface dose for reporting when non - rigid registration is used , because non - rigid registration sometimes produces artifacts by condensing or stretching volumes . the present study also implies that the surface dose can be used in the prediction of radiation morbidity in the walls of a hollow organ . although the present study proposed a non - rigid registration - based assessment for the dose reconstruction of a previously irradiated dose to the post - treatment organ with large deformation , the technique has so far been applied in only one case of tracheal cancer treated with hdr - ebt and ebrt . general validation for other treatment sites with other organs at risk , different inter - fraction variations , and more inhomogeneous and complex dose distributions is still a big challenge . the image - processing framework based on gmm - reg enabled to correlate the cumulative surface dose of hdr - ebt and ebrt with the location of radiation injury , by applying it to one case of tracheal cancer . this technique seems to be a promising tool that might be applied to other treatment sites in the future .\",\n",

however , the blood pressure was maintained at the baseline . surgeon was notified ; however , there was no other option left except to continue separating dura from the tumor . each episode of bradycardia was terminated with a bolus of 50  mg of propofol intravenously . at the end of the procedure the muscle relaxant was reversed with neostigmine 2.5  mg and 0.4  mg glycopyrrolate . this case highlights the unique neurogenic mechanism that is known as tcr and that manifests as severe bradycardia ( and/or arterial hypotension ) during stimulation of fifth nerve innervated dural covering . there is a correlation of severity of bradycardia and slightness of anesthesia . in the light of the larger distribution of the tcr all over the world , we see more and more aborted tcr , as seen in the present case , then the neuroanesthesists more and more recognize the tcr at its very beginning . as these tcr episodes were aborted by boluses of propofol , a surrogate concept can be derived regarding the depth of anesthesia related to the tcr occurrence . as during this case , we were not using any depth of anesthesia monitor , what is a clinical reality , so we can only associate plausibility by the sequence of events , by repetitive and reversible related causative mechanisms and by the prevention of the whole tcr occurrence by propofol . additionally , the current case confirms , for the first time for the central tcr , what is already know for the tcr in the meta - area of the ganglion gasseri , that arrhythmias seems to be the more susceptible symptoms of the tcr occurrence . the arrhythmia is therefore a first and important surrogate model for the tcr on the one side and for the depth of anesthesia on the other side . the development of such a surrogate model was necessary as the tcr has reached the level that nowadays often the tcr is partly or fully abolished what reflects not at least in decreasing prevalence in different meta - areas . whether or not , increasing depth with volatile agents would result similar abolition of reflex as seen in this case with propofol is matter of further investigation . however , in neurosurgical patients , increasing the depth of anesthesia by volatile agents does not seem to be a reasonable choice . should the use of anticholinergics be the primary mode of management in such case , is debatable . it not only reduces the chances of detection of neurogenic reflexes , but also may cause significant hemodynamic alterations and is finally best known  because of pharmacological mechanism of action  to be unable to fully abolish the tcr . in special cases , the preventive topical application of lidocaine could be a solution . we present here a tcr case that necessitates us to overthink the theoretical cerebral state index ( csi ) model in tcr and the clinical definition of the tcr . we have therefore developed , for the first the time , a surrogate model that helps in daily practice to recognize and prevent tcr episodes .\",\n",

up . cranial / orbit magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and electroencephalography ( eeg ) were normal . however , electron microscopy of buffy coat showed rare , membrane bound , electron dense , granular material associated with a lipid droplet in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes . leukocyte enzyme analysis showed very low level of palmitoyl protein transferase ( ppt ) activity measuring 2.2 nmol / hr / mg ptn ( normal = 17139 ) and normal tripeptidyl peptidase i ( tpp - i ) 214 nmol / hr / mg ptn ( normal : 42339 ) . molecular genetic analysis of exon 1 to 9 of cln1 gene showed that he was heterozygote for p.cys96tyr and p.arg151x mutations . a diagnosis of milder form of incl ( cln1 ) was made . at his last neurology follow - up at 12 years and 10 months , his vision remained poor . juvenile ncl is diagnosed on the basis of age - at - onset , initial clinical symptoms , clinical progression of the disease , and pathologic findings . typical / classic jcnl is characterised clinically by slowly progressive visual loss at age 47 years , with blindness within 210 years . speech disturbance , cognitive decline , epilepsy , behavioural or psychiatric symptoms , and motor dysfunction , leading to vegetative state usually in later life . the consistent findings in all typical jncl are fingerprint profile at the ultra structural ( em ) level and the common 1.02 kb cln3 mutation . atypical forms of jncl , up to 20% of jncl cases , have been described and further divided into the several subgroups . our case manifested atypical clinico - pathological features and probably belongs to a non - retinal adolescent form of jcnl . further pathological , biochemical and genetic analysis confirmed that our case represented a milder form of incl presenting at a later stage . funduscopic examination reveals a bulls eye maculopathy , diffuse pigmentary degeneration , arteriolar attenuation , and optic atrophy , and an extinguished erg . differences from these typical features in our case included normal erg , delayed vep , and persistent normal fundi even at an advanced stage where profound and prolonged visual loss was noted . other disorders consistent with a delayed vep include demyelinating optic neuropathy , dominant optic atrophy , lebers optic neuropathy , and others but abnormal appearance of the optic disc is expected at this late stage . medline search found that normal fundi / non - retinal adolescence form , and delayed vep have been reported . retinal dystrophy is common features in jcnl while optic atrophy may be the sole finding in incl ( cln1 ) . this may explain normal erg , delayed vep , and normal fundi as our case belongs to a non - retinal adolescence form of atypical jcnl secondary to cln1 mutation , rather than cln3 . however , normal fundi may still correspond to a very early stage ( 4 years duration ) of juvenile phenotype of ncl although ophthalmologic changes usually appear early . the most puzzling feature in our case is that vision of his right eye was reported normal ( 6/6 ) 6 months after the first presentation . our ophthalmologist was pleased with his improvement and commented that patient had enrolled in an archery course for the summer and was doing fairly well . we are unable to explain this phenomenon but we exclude any technical or typing errors . at early stage , visual loss in juvenile phenotype of cln1 could be due to optic neuritis in which intermittent visual loss is a known feature , rather than chronic progressive loss secondary to retinal dystrophy . low level of ptt , granular profiles of storage material in lymphocyte and positive cln1 mutation confirmed that our case represented a milder form of incl presenting at juvenile stage . over the past few decades , new molecular findings have provided evidence of far more overlap for the different genetic variants than what was previously suggested by clinical phenotypes . infantile ncl ( incl ) is the most common form of cln1 mutation , presenting at the first year of life with rapid decline in psychomotor development , seizures , and blindness . factors influencing age of onset and clinical severity remain obscured but the variability of disease does not seem to be related to degree of ppt deficiency . other unknown genetic factors are supposed to modify the course of disease in such patients . p.arg151x is predicted to cause premature termination of the ptt protein and has previously been described in patients with batten disease . c.287 g > a is predicted to result in the substitution of cysteine for tyrosine at residue 96 ( p.cys96tyr ) . cys96 is conserved between species ( human , mouse , rat , and dog ) and no other mutations have been found in the cln gene . assuming that p.cys96tyr and p.arg151x occur in trans , the result is consistent with a diagnosis of infantile ncl / batten disease . to conclude , our reports add another case to the list of cln1 variants known worldwide . our experiences might recommend that ncl should be excluded in any unexplained progressive visual loss even with normal fundi , delayed vep , and/or normal erg .',\n",

however , it must be confirmed by radiologic characteristic imaging . cone beam computed tomography was obtained from a 60-year - old female in order to assess implant insertion sites . in clinical examination , a mild facial asymmetry was detected and deviation of nasal septum to the left was apparent [ figures 1 and 2 ] . in regard to medical history , the patient was completely asymptomatic , with normal visual acuity , unaffected extraocular movements , no diplopia , and no obvious rhinitis . the patient reported recurrent and frequent sinusitis along with the difficulty in breathing during the last 5 years . nasal septum deviation was diagnosed by an otolaryngologist as the main cause of the respiratory problem of the patient . the patient had no facial trauma , systemic infection , cranial malformation , or tumor . computed tomography performed in the axial , sagittal , and coronal planes revealed a hypoplastic opacified left maxillary sinus with thinning and depression of the orbital floor and posterolateral sinus wall . the uncinate process appeared lateralized and adherent to the lamina papyracea , blocking the osteomeatal complex drainage [ figures 35 ] . a mild facial asymmetry and deviation of nasal septum to the left side deviation of nasal septum to the left side coronal view of cone beam computed tomograph of the parasinuses demonstrate completely opacified and atelectatic maxillary sinus with inward bowing of all of the right maxillary sinus walls ;

the primary one is maxillary sinus volume loss due to inward retraction of the sinus walls , which is the main reason for the increased orbital volume and enlargement of the middle meatus . it is the typical case to have all four sinus walls retracted , however , one of the medial , anterior , or posterolateral walls may be excluded . there is always retracted and usually thinned orbital floor ( maxillary floor ) . illner et al . reported a study conducted on five patients with sss , among them , three patients showed inward retraction of all four sinus walls ( roof , anterior , medial , and posterolateral ) into the sinus . all of them showed increased orbital volume on the affected side , which was due to downward retraction of the sinus roof ( orbital floor ) into the maxillary sinus . the uncinate process is retracted against the inferomedial aspect of the orbital wall . despite several proposed theories , absolute pathophysiological development of sss the most acceptable theory is that the complete obstruction of the ostium is the main reason of the prolonged negative pressure in the maxillary sinus , which leads in hypoventilation and the accumulation of secretions . the gas resorption causes negative pressure , which in its turn may lead in osteopenia , bone remodeling , and sinus wall retraction . the result is thinner orbital floor , which fails to support the orbital content , with expansion into the sinus and resulting in enophthalmos . it is crucial to diagnose sss correctly , as different conditions causing spontaneous enophthalmos require different treatment and prognosis . tumor , trauma , congenital facial asymmetry , diffuse facial lipodystrophy , parry - romberg syndrome , and linear scleroderma are common sources of an incorrect diagnosis of sss . the treatment is done to restore a normal ventilation of the maxillary sinus and the normal position of the ocular globe . today , the gold standard treatment to restore sinus function and preserving the maxillary structures is functional endoscopic surgery with uncinectomy and antrostomy . there are reports of considering it as a second - stage operation , which is commonly done 2 months after the sinus surgery , due to complete or partial resolution of the enophthalmos , with over - correction in the case of immediate orbital floor reconstruction resulting from the resolution of the hypoventilation and restoration of the normal intra - sinus pressure . it is also noticeable that in cases with sever enophthalmos , reconstruction of the orbital floor is inevitable and morbidity , patient discomfort , and hospitalization can be reduced by a single - stage operation . due to negative sinus cultures in most cases , by performing primary reconstruction , there would be no risk of infection . since the complications of sss such as upper lid retraction , malar depression , facial asymmetry , diplopia , and enophthalmos can be prevented by timely diagnosis and dentist may be the first specialist encounters radiographies of these patients , so it seems to be important to introduce this rare syndrome for dentists .',\n",

the biopsy revealed massive hepatocellular necrosis prominently in the centrilobular area with moderate inflammatory infiltration mainly of lymphocytes and neutrophils . we also detected diffuse swelling of the hepatocytes and hemorrhagic infiltration in some necrotic areas . the patient responded well to treatment , and gradually , his general condition improved and all symptoms eventually resolved except for poor appetite and fatigue . the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 26 and advised to completely avoid exposure to pce at his workplace . the patient underwent regular follow - up every month , and liver function and afp level became normal after 2 months . repeat liver biopsy performed 6 months after discharge showed fibrous expansion of the portal tracts caused by moderate inflammatory infiltration and nodular regeneration of the hepatic parenchyma delimited by thin fibrous bands and septa . the biopsy showed evidence of some swollen hepatocytes and scattered foci of hepatocellular necrosis within the liver lobules ( fig . currently , the patient is undergoing anti - liver fibrosis therapy using modern chinese medicine ( fuzhenghuayu capsule ) ( 6 ) and continues to receive follow - up . pce is mainly absorbed by mammals following inhalation and , to a lesser extent , by ingestion and dermal exposure ( 2 , 4 ) . most of the absorbed pce ( 80%-90% ) is excreted unchanged in expired air , regardless of the route of exposure , whereas only a small proportion ( 1%-3% ) is metabolized to tca , trichloroethanol , and trichloroacetyl chloride , which were subsequently eliminated in urine ( 2 , 7 ) . the serum half - life of pce is estimated at 65 hr , and that of urinary tca at 144 hr ( 8 , 9 ) . biotransformation of pce occurs predominantly in the liver via cytochrome p-450 ( cyp ) oxidation pathway , which accounts for the highest percentage of metabolites ( 2 ) . glutathione conjugation pathway , though a minor route , is activated when cyp oxidation is saturated ( 2 , 10 ) . there is evidence that tca , the principal metabolite of pce , derived from cyp pathway may mainly contribute to hepatotoxicity via several modes of action , including oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction , and dna damage ( 11 ) . few studies have indicated that pce may exert suppressive effects on the immune system ( 12 ) . however , our patient showed a remarkably high cd4/cd8 ratio at the initial presentation , indicating the possibility of a pce - triggered cell - mediated immune response that might induce hepatocellular damage . in addition , the hepatic injury in our patient was more severe than those reported in patients in previous studies , and no abnormalities were detected in his colleagues who were exposed to the same conditions at work . we postulated that these differences may be attributable to genetic polymorphism in metabolizing enzymes , which might lead to variations among the level of susceptibility of individual to pce toxicity ( 11 ) . other factors such as age , sex , pattern of activity , health status , and alcohol consumption also influence pce metabolism and toxicity . meckler et al . ( 13 ) reported hepatocellular injury detected by liver biopsy in a woman with acute hepatitis after exposure to pce . ( 14 ) reported a case of an infant presenting with obstructive jaundice and hepatomegaly due to pce exposure via breast milk . brodkin et al . ( 15 ) reported hepatic ultrasonography findings showing diffuse parenchymal changes in dry cleaners in comparison with ultrasonography findings in control subjects . liver damage in the form of hepatomegaly , jaundice , and elevation in levels of several hepatic transaminases and bilirubin has also been reported . in most cases , hepatotoxicity was transient , and its effects were spontaneously resolved when exposure to pce ended . thus far , no study has reported acute liver failure associated with pce exposure . initially , the patient \\'s condition was similar to viral hepatitis and rapidly deteriorated , resulting in marked liver dysfunction , coagulopathy , and encephalopathy . on the basis of the patient \\'s occupational history , clinical manifestations , laboratory data , and liver biopsy findings , acute liver failure was attributable to occupational exposure to pce , after other liver diseases had been completely excluded . we also assessed the patient using maria and victorino \\'s clinical diagnostic scale for drug - induced liver injury , and on the basis of his score 14 , he was judged \" probable \" ( 16 ) . liver injuries caused by drugs are classified as three types : hepatocellular , cholestatic , and mixed injury ( 17 ) . our case presented with notably increased alt level of 1,100 u / l and an alt / alp ratio more than 5 , suggesting a hepatocellular injury pattern . treatment for pce - induced hepatotoxicity requires supportive care with close monitoring to prevent associated toxicities to other systemic organs . our patient developed acute liver failure , which was a rare medical condition associated with high mortality . on the basis of model for end - stage liver disease ( meld ) score of 30 , the patient was a candidate for living - related orthotropic liver transplantation ( 18 ) . plasmapheresis has been successfully used in management of acute or chronic liver failure , and it serves a treatment modality to achieve recovery of native liver function or until an appropriate donor is available . although plasmapheresis has no established effects on elimination of serum pce due to its relatively small molecular weight and short half time , it is an effective approach for removing various endogenous toxins and immune complexes from systemic circulation , decreasing serum aminotransferase level , and improving the encephalopathy stage and coagulation profiles ( 19 ) . all these effects of plasmapheresis may create a better internal environment for native hepatocyte regeneration and change the final outcomes in liver failure . our patient may have benefited from plasmapheresis , as was evident by the notable improvement of clinical status and liver function . due to the adjuvant evidence of increase in the cd4/cd8 ratio indeed , his survival can be mainly attributed to the sufficient residual hepatic capacity for regeneration , as evidenced by the short - term dramatically high levels of serum afp , with maximum value being more than 150 times greater than the normal range . initial biopsy revealed massive hepatic necrosis , primarily , in zone 3 , which was consistent with the fact that hepatocytes in zone 3 were probably more susceptible to chemical - induced hepatotoxicity owing to the high concentration of cyp in these cells . furthermore , although his liver function test revealed persistently normal results for approximately 4 months , repeat biopsy revealed foci of hepatocellular necrosis and lymphocytic piecemeal necrosis with inflammatory infiltration . therefore , since liver function test can not completely reflect the severity of liver injury and may give a falsely optimistic suggestion , liver biopsy is a better approach to assess the prognosis of liver disease . our patient \\'s liver histology examination also showed typical postnecrotic cirrhosis , which was a result of active repair following massive hepatic necrosis . liver cirrhosis , in fact , is a rare sequel to drug - induced acute hepatitis , but it may occur if liver disease progresses to active chronic hepatitis , in which long - term liver lesions maintain . moreover , a single episode of sufficiently severe injury , such as massive / submassive hepatic necrosis , can also cause liver cirrhosis due to collapse of lobular architecture and irregularly scarred repair . a rapid progression from severe hepatitis to cirrhosis , which is similar to that seen in our patient , has been documented in ebrotidine -

       " {'article': 'various antidepressants especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) are known to cause hyponatremia , especially in elderly and those with medical comorbidities or on polypharmacy . hyponatremia is also reported with other antidepressants , few antipsychotics and with mood stabilizers like carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine . however , among various antidepressants , there is limited literature to suggest association of mirtazapine and hyponatremia . in our review of literature ( done in early september 2013 by using pubmed ) , we could find only five cases of mirtazapine - induced hyponatremia . a review of these cases suggests that all these patients were elderly who had multiple physical comorbidities which by themselves predispose to hyponatremia . in this report , we present a case of mirtazapine - induced severe hyponatremia , which was seen in an adult patient , was related to the dose of mirtazapine and appeared within few hours of intake of increased dose of mirtazapine . a 46-year - old widow female , low socioeconomic status , with poor social support , who was premorbidly well adjusted , presented to psychiatric outpatient clinic with an acute onset illness , precipitated by family stress in the form of her son marrying against her wishes , of 4 months duration , progressive in nature , characterized by persistent sadness , bodyaches , lethargy , anhedonia , depressive cognition , anxiety spells , decreased sleep , and decreased appetite . her past history did not reveal any significant medical or psychiatric history and there was no family history of mental illness . her body weight was 54 kg , body mass index was 22.5 kg / m , and her blood pressure was in the normal range . she was diagnosed with moderate depressive episode without somatic syndrome ( icd-10 ) . because of marked sleep disturbance , mirtazapine was preferred and she was started on tab . mirtazapine 7.5 mg / day , which was increased to 15 mg / day after 4 days along with tab . routine investigations in the form of hemogram , serum electrolytes , renal function test , liver function test , fasting blood sugar levels , lipid profile were done , which did not reveal any abnormality . over the period of 4 weeks , her sleep and anxiety improved marginally , with overall 30% improvement in symptomatology ( score on hamilton depression rating decreased from 18 to 13 ) , following which tab . however , immediately after the increase in the dose of mirtazapine , her difficulty in falling asleep reappeared along with intermittent awakening . next morning , she was noticed to be restless , appeared confused and agitated . as the day progressed , she became disoriented to time , place and person , irritable , had labile affect , and her speech became incomprehensible . she was found to have disorientation to time , place and person , poor attention and concentration , impairment in short - term memory , labile affect , and incomprehensible speech . physical examination did not reveal any evidence of dehydration , hypervolumia , and her pulse rate and blood pressure were in the normal physiological limits . history did not reveal any evidence of head injury , taking over the counter medications or any overdose , restriction of diet , drug or alcohol abuse , and excessive intake of water . her mini - mental state scale score was 6 and her revised delirium rating scale ( drs-98 ) score was 21 . she was investigated including a computerised tomography of brain , x - ray chest , ultrasound abdomen , liver function test , serum urea and creatinine , serum electrolytes , and random blood sugar levels . no abnormality was noted except for evidence of hyponatremia ( serum sodium level 123 meq / l ) . she was managed with water restriction and intravenous sodium replacement with isotonic saline slow intravenous drip . over the next 2 days , her mental state improved , along with normalization of serum sodium ( 138 meq / l ) . her mini  mental state examination ( mmse ) improved to 30 and her drs - r-98 score reduced to 7 . after a weeks time , serum sodium levels were repeated , which was in the normal range ( 138 meq / l ) , following which she was started on tab . milnacipran 100 mg / day , with which her depression remitted and she has been maintaining well with milnacipran for the last 5 months . index case exemplifies an association of hyponatremia with mirtazapine . on the naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale , the score of index case was 7 , suggesting a probable association of hyponatremia and mirtazapine . in contrast to the most of literature , which suggests association of mirtazapine and hyponatremia in the presence of risk factors like advance age , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , concomitant prescription of medications known to cause hyponatremia , in the index case hyponatremia was noted in an adult patient who had no medical comorbidity and was not on any concomitant medications . studies which have found association of hyponatremia and other antidepressants have also reported low body weight and renal dysfunction to be other risk factors for development of hyponatremia . another interesting observation noted in the patient was emergence of hyponatremia , immediately after increasing the dose of mirtazapine from 15 to 22.5 mg / day . studies in literature have not focused much on the relationship of dosage of psychotropics and development of hyponatremia . though a few case reports of relatively later onset of hyponatremia has also been documented in the literature , this is contrary to the usual notion that antidepressant - induced hyponatremia occurs within a month of initiation and is unrelated to the dose of medication . mirtazapine is a serotonin receptor blocker which also effects norepinephrine through blockade of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor . the hyponatremia noted in patients with mirtazapine may possibly be mediated by the same syndrome of inappropriate anti - diuretic hormone secretion ( siadh ) mechanism mediated by its effect on serotonin . effect of antidepressants on 5-ht and 5-ht1c receptors has been thought to responsible for relapse of anti - diuretic hormone ( adh ) . however , the exact mechanism which can explain mirtazapine - induced or ssri - induced hyponatremia is not known . the case suggests that there is merit in monitoring serum sodium levels while increasing the dose of mirtazapine in apparently physically healthy subjects .',\n",

       " {'article': \"in august 2000 , a 38-year - old thai man came to an outpatient department of king chulalongkorn memorial hospital , bangkok , with daily fever , headache , intermittent chill , sweating , and malaise for 4 days . his home was in a suburb of bangkok , where no malaria transmission has been reported . during the past few months before the present illness , he spent several few weeks in a hilly forest area in prachuap khiri khan province in southern thailand , 300 km from bangkok near the thai - myanmar border . he did not know of any underlying illness and had not experienced any previous malaria attacks . although he stayed in a cottage and slept inside a mosquito net , he remembered being bitten frequently by mosquitoes , especially at dusk and dawn . upon examination , his hemoglobin was 14.0 g / dl , hematocrit was 0.4 , and erythrocyte count was 4.2 x 10 cells/l . levels of other laboratory investigations , including urinalysis , blood sugar , liver function test , blood urea nitrogen , and creatinine , were normal . examination of giemsa - stained thin blood films showed 10% young trophozoites , 45% growing trophozoites , 40% schizonts , and 5% gametocytes ( n = 300 ) . the parasite structure was compatible with that of p. malariae . the parasite density inferred from the number of malarial parasites per 500 leukocytes in thick blood smear yielded 1,155/l or equivalent to parasitemia 0.03% . the patient was treated with 10 mg / kg of oral chloroquine initially , followed by 5 mg / kg , 6 hours later on the day 1 , and 5 mg / kg / day for the next 2 days . on day 2 , with a temperature of 37.5c , he came to the hospital . meanwhile , we recently evaluated a dna - based diagnostic method by the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) targeting the small subunit ribosomal rna ( ssu rrna ) genes of all four species of human malaria as reported ( 8) . ten isolates each for p. falciparum , p. vivax , and p. malariae and four isolates of p. ovale were used as positive controls . results showed that all isolates gave concordant positive pcr products with those diagnosed by microscopy except an isolate from this patient ( data not shown ) . retrospective examination of blood smears has shown several developmental stages of malaria parasites similar to those typically seen in p. malariae . however , some erythrocytes that harbored mature asexual parasites possessed fimbriated margins . the cytoplasm of some young trophozoites appeared spread out into the network of irregular pseudopodia , and the chromatin was distributed into fragments , conforming to the tenue forms . pinkish dots varying from fine to large irregular masses called sinton and mulligan 's stippling developed intracorpuscularly with the maturation of some parasites ( figure 1 ) . giemsa - stained thin blood films depicting a ) ring stage , b ) tenue form of young trophozoite , c ) band - shaped growing trophozoite , d ) growing trophozoite with little or no amoeboid activity , e ) double growing trophozoites , f ) early schizont , g ) late schizont in an erythrocyte with fimbriated margins , and h ) mature macrogametocyte . discernible sinton and mulligan stippling is in c , d , and f. to elucidate the species of malaria infecting our patient , we determined the ssu rrna gene by using similar methods as described by others ( 9 ) , except that extaq dna polymerase ( takara , japan ) , pgem - t vector ( promega , usa ) , and escherichia coli strain jm109 were used . results showed that the ssu rrna sequence contained 97.8% to 99.6% homology with those of p. knowlesi transcribed during asexual stages or the type a gene ( genbank accession no . nucleotide sequence data reported in this study are available in the embl , genbank , and ddjb databases under the accession no . phylogenetic tree showed that p. knowlesi in this study was closely related to the w1 and nuri strains , although its divergence from malaysian human isolates was not supported by bootstrap analysis ( figure 2 ) . consistently , the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of this isolate , determined by the methods similar to previous report except the pcr primers ( mtpk - f:5-aggtattatattctttatacaaatattaac-3  and mtpk - r:5-tcttttataatgaacaagtgtaaataatc-3  ) , displayed perfect sequence identity with that of p. knowlesi strain h from monkey ( af069621 ) ( 4 ) . neighbor - joining tree based on the asexually transcribed ssu rrna sequences displaying the phylogenetic position of isolate a1 in this study in relation to other plasmodium knowlesi isolates ( ay327549-ay327556 from humans , and l07560 , u72542 , and ay327557 from monkeys ) and p. fragile ( m61722 ) . p. knowlesi is prevalent among crab - eating macaques , macaca fascicularis , in the malaysian peninsula and the philippines ( 2,10 ) . other known natural hosts include pig - tailed macaques , m. nemestrina , and leaf monkeys , presbytis melalophos ( 2,10 ) . ( 11 ) had shown that p. knowlesi isolated from monkey could be infectious to humans , the first naturally acquired human infection with p. knowlesi was not reported until 1965 ( 6 ) ; the patient was infected in a malaysian forest . in 1971 the second case , albeit presumptive , occurred in a man who also acquired the infection in a forest in malaysia ( 12 ) . recently , a large cluster of human infections caused by p. knowlesi has been identified from malaysian borneo ( 9 ) . our report has expanded the geographic range for natural transmission of p. knowlesi to a forest in thailand near southern myanmar border , where wild populations of crab - eating macaques , despite being considered endangered , are still substantial . the prevalence of naturally acquired primate malaria in humans can be underestimated from examination of blood films . the reported abundance of ring stages of p. knowlesi found in the first naturally acquired human case led to the initial diagnosis of p. falciparum , while the mature parasites could masquerade as those of p. malariae , as we encountered in this patient ( 6 ) . although structural descriptions of young trophozoites of p. knowlesi have been delineated , we were unable to find the ring form with double chromatin dots ( 9 ) . conversely , a few young trophozoites resembled the tenue forms , proposed by stephens in 1914 ( 13 ) to be a distinct species . however , the tenue form has recently been recognized to be a p. malariae variant found in myanmar ( 8) . the presence of the tenue form in the blood smears of our patient , despite the low number , rather suggests a shared structural feature among species of malaria . the possibility of coinfection between p. knowlesi with one or more of the four human malaria species was not supported by our pcr detection . the structure of p. knowlesi is highly dependent on the host erythrocytes , i.e. , resembling p. vivax in m. fascicularis , p. falciparum in rhesus monkeys , and p. malariae in humans ( 2,9,11,12 ) . although stippling was not seen among p. knowlesi  infected blood smears of sarawak 's patients , the presence of sinton - mulligan stippling in infected erythrocytes in this study is in accord with the report by fong et al . , in which erythrocytic stippling served as one of the diagnostic feature ( 9,12 ) . such discrepancy could partly arise from differences in the condition for giemsa staining , infecting parasite strains , or both . the complete asexual erythrocytic cycle of p. knowlesi in human and its natural macaque host requires 24 hours , coinciding with a quotidian fever pattern . however , fever pattern per se may not be a precise indicator for differentiating malaria caused by p. knowlesi and p. malariae . although the merogony cycle of p. malariae has been generally known to be 72 hours , fever patterns might not be strictly quartan ( 14 ) . meanwhile , the preexisting immunity to p. vivax has reportedly conferred partial resistance to induced infection during malariotherapy ( 2 ) . whether naturally acquired immunity against p. vivax can reduce symptoms in p. knowlesi infection requires further investigation . to date , little is known about the extent of variation in the p. knowlesi population . analysis of the ssu rrna gene from the isolate in this study has shown minor difference from those of p. knowlesi from monkeys and patients in malaysian borneo ( 3,9 ) . evidence from malariotherapy showed that p. knowlesi could lose or increase its virulence on blood passage in humans , which suggests that strain difference could occur in wild populations and might effect humans differently ( 2 ) . in conclusion , p. knowlesi could contribute to the reemergence of simian malaria in thailand and southeast asia , where its vectors , anopheles leucosphyrus group , are abundant ( 15 ) .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'cerebral palsy is a nonprogressive neurological disorder resulting from brain injury that occurs before cerebral development is complete and affects approximately 22.5 children per 1000 live births in the united states.1 symptoms include permanent movement and posture disorders that may present with impairment in body function and structure , such as abnormal muscle tone , strength , range of motion ( rom ) , and reflexes.2,3 physical therapy for patients with cerebral palsy is commonly prescribed to improve capabilities , increase functionality , and sustain health in terms of cognitive development , locomotion , social interaction , and independence.1 impaired strength , decreased rom , and abnormal muscle tone may further lead to soft tissue pathology and dysfunction . muscle spasticity has been shown to affect the integrity of tendon structure and the extracellular matrix.46 this may lead to breakdown of the tendon tissue resulting in chronic tendinopathy . treating chronic soft tissue dysfunction , such as tendinopathy , is challenging . the challenges may be even greater when the soft tissue dysfunction is contributed by a chronic neurologic condition such as cerebral palsy . an effective treatment for soft tissue dysfunction in a child with cerebral palsy requires a unique treatment approach . astym therapy is a promising treatment that has been shown to be effective in the management of various soft tissue dysfunctions and conditions such as hamstring tendinopathy,7 patellar tendinopathy,8 and both mid - portion9 and insertional achilles tendinopathy.10 astym therapy was conceived and developed by a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in physiology , as well as the nature of soft tissue degeneration and scar formation . the team reviewed emerging theories on tissue regeneration and developed specific protocols aiming to remodel and regenerate the tissue . a preparatory line of research preceded clinical trials to explore and substantiate the cellular impact of astym treatment.11 astym treatment is a noninvasive soft tissue therapy that utilizes handheld instrumentation to topically address soft tissue dysfunction.7 the astym instrumentation is designed to assess the presence of dysfunctional tissue by amplifying the tactile sensation of the underlying texture of the soft tissues in order to provide the treating clinician with indications where rough or improperly organized tissue is located.11 as the instruments glide over dysfunctional areas , they catch on the irregular fibrosis and give the clinician and the patient a sensation of roughness.11 astym therapy has been shown to improve muscle strength12 and appears to affect neurologic functioning , as patients frequently report a sense of ease of movement immediately following treatment.13 primary goals of astym therapy include engaging the regenerative mechanisms of the body and stimulating tissue turnover for reabsorption of inappropriate fibrosis , thereby encouraging functional alignment of the soft tissue and regenerating healthy tissue in the affected areas.9 the treatment approach includes an exercise protocol to help stimulate tendon healing at the cellular level.7,9,11 achieving these treatment goals then reduces subjective complaints of restrictions in motion and improves function.13,14 astym therapy has consistently demonstrated safety and effectiveness in the soft tissue conditions studied and is also well tolerated by patients.710 however , it is important to recognize that instrument - assisted soft tissue mobilization ( iastm ) interventions are not showing similar results . although the iastm methods use tools to treat the tissue , the methods and results are quite different from those of astym therapy , and iastm methods are often not well tolerated by patients.15 iastm methods use tooled cross - friction massage to mechanically break apart the tissue,16,17 whereas astym therapy engages the regenerative mechanisms of the body aiming to repair damaged tissue and resorb scar tissue.11 to date , iastm methods have been shown to ( 1 ) result in a significant increase in pain and a significant decrease in the perception of function,15 ( 2 ) have no positive effect in the treatment results for ankle injury,18 ( 3 ) be comparable to no treatment being provided in tendinopathy,19 and ( 4 ) not improve treatment results with tools , when compared with manual therapy alone.20 to date , no publications have documented the use of astym treatment on a patient with a chronic underlying neurological condition . the purpose of this case report was to describe the incorporation of astym treatment to improve hamstring flexibility and achilles tendinopathy in a child with cerebral palsy . this retrospective case report describes a physical therapy intervention utilizing an astym therapy protocol for an eight - year - old female with a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy referred to physical therapy for bilateral hamstring tissue tension and achilles tendinopathy . functional limitations reported by the patient included bending / squatting , lifting / carrying , sitting / standing , reaching , pushing , pulling , activities of daily living ( adls ) , and sleeping due to pain . previous treatment interventions included use of night splints and daytime in - shoe orthotics for several years . the patient ambulated into the facility independently with in - shoe orthotics . the patient s gait pattern presented with shortened stride length , lack of proper heel strike / toe - off , and weak quadriceps causing hyperextension during mid - stance bilaterally . the subject did not present with any abnormal restrictions to active motion of the hips , knees , and first metatarsophalangeal joints . active rom and passive rom of bilateral ankles were restricted ( see table 1 ) . no assessment of lower extremity reflexes was reported . the popliteal angle to assess hamstring flexibility was measured by extending the knee from a position of 90 flexion of the hip joint and measured at arom 140 bilaterally via goniometric measurement . the patient subjectively reported her lower extremity pain ranged from 0 to 8 on a 10-point scale ( 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible pain ) and rated her pain at the time of the initial examination as 0/10 . based on the findings of examination , it was determined that the patient had decreased functional strength and lower extremity flexibility secondary to increased tone of cerebral palsy causing bilateral achilles tendon pain . each treatment session began with a warm - up on a stationary bicycle for four to six minutes . this was followed by topical application of the instruments to the soft tissue structures of both lower extremities . the treatment was performed by applying instruments topically in a systematic pattern in order to deliver particular pressures and shear forces to the underlying dysfunctional tissue ( see fig . the patient reported that she tolerated the astym treatments well , reporting after the first treatment that it helped her legs relax . astym therapy was followed by lower extremity stretching of the quadriceps in prone , hamstrings in supine with the knee , and hips in a 90/90 position , long sitting hamstrings stretch against the wall , standing gastrocnemius / soleus stretch , supine piriformis stretch , hip flexor stretch , and adductor stretch , with a hold time of 3060 seconds for three sets each . as pain decreased and activity tolerance increased , the physical therapy treatments were progressed to aim toward improving functional strength . therapeutic exercises were progressed based on pain tolerance and consisted of long arc quad , bear crawl , crab crawl , single leg balance activities while kicking a ball , and running mechanics to improve coordination , fluidity , and speed . the patient ambulated into the facility independently with in - shoe orthotics . the patient s gait pattern presented with shortened stride length , lack of proper heel strike / toe - off , and weak quadriceps causing hyperextension during mid - stance bilaterally . the subject did not present with any abnormal restrictions to active motion of the hips , knees , and first metatarsophalangeal joints . active rom and passive rom of bilateral ankles were restricted ( see table 1 ) . no assessment of lower extremity reflexes was reported . the popliteal angle to assess hamstring flexibility was measured by extending the knee from a position of 90 flexion of the hip joint and measured at arom 140 bilaterally via goniometric measurement . the patient subjectively reported her lower extremity pain ranged from 0 to 8 on a 10-point scale ( 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible pain ) and rated her pain at the time of the initial examination as 0/10 . based on the findings of examination , it was determined that the patient had decreased functional strength and lower extremity flexibility secondary to increased tone of cerebral palsy causing bilateral achilles tendon pain . each treatment session began with a warm -

up two years after treatment did express continued positive functional status of the patient , suggesting possible long - term carry - over of the treatment intervention . however , there was no physical contact during the time frames between discharge and telephone follow - up to determine if the objective improvements were sustained . this case report demonstrated positive outcomes utilizing astym therapy administered by an astym - certified physical therapist for the treatment of decreased hamstring flexibility and achilles tendinopathy in an eight - year - old female with a medical diagnosis of infantile cerebral palsy . the physical changes achieved following treatment allowed for improvement of gait , running mechanics , sit - to - stand transfers , and peer play . the patient was able to discontinue the use of afo devices and showed improved quality of gait with equity in stride length and diminished genu recurvatum during ambulation . the results of this case report support the use of astym therapy for the treatment of hamstring flexibility and achilles tendinosis in a child with cerebral palsy . this is the first documentation of the clinical use of astym therapy for the treatment of soft tissue dysfunction and restrictions for an individual with cerebral palsy . factors that likely contributed to the patient s positive outcomes include compliance to an appropriate home exercise program carried out by the patient and reinforced by the patient s mother and consistency in administration of the astym protocol in the clinical environment . all treatment sessions were conducted by an experienced astym - certified physical therapist , implementing an astym protocol with optimal stroke speed for muscular relaxation to provide benefit in a child with cerebral palsy . astym therapy has been previously shown to be effective in the treatment of soft tissue limitations . literature has shown significant gains in function for recreational athletes with soft tissue restriction of the hamstrings and achilles tendinopathy.7,9 astym therapy has been shown to be effective in improving rom in patients with stiff knee / athrofibrosis following total knee arthroplasty.14 studies have demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms within a notably shorter duration with the use of astym treatment compared to an eccentric program alone in treating hamstring and achilles tendinopathies.7,9,10 the results of this case demonstrate the positive treatment effects of astym therapy in a young patient with cerebral palsy . while this case study demonstrates the successful implementation of astym therapy in a child with soft tissue dysfunction and a chronic neurological disease , several limitations to this research exist . formal functional evaluation scales , such as lower extremity functional scale and the short - form 36 , were not incorporated in the clinical evaluations of this patient , limiting the ability to compare the results of this case with those in the research literature that have used such evaluation criteria . subjective assessments were made regarding gait characteristics , pain , muscle tone , and strength assessment . while an informal telephone follow - up was performed two years posttreatment , no formal long - term clinical assessment was made of the patient , thus limiting the objective assessment of the effects of astym treatment . as with any single patient case report , the efficacy of the studied intervention in this case could not be compared to that of other treatment interventions . future research is needed to objectively assess the long - term effects of an astym protocol for children with cerebral palsy and compare the efficacy of asytm therapy to other appropriate treatment methods . such studies should include objective measures of spasticity , strength , functional performance , and pain perception over the course of time to assess the long - term effects of astym therapy for soft tissue dysfunction . a clinically controlled trial with an adequate sample size may provide results that may be generalizable to populations of various age , sex , and classifications of cerebral palsy . following an astym therapy protocol incorporating eccentric exercise , stretching , strengthening , a / prom , gait training , and a home exercise program over an eight - week period , the patient demonstrated significant gains in flexibility , functional strength , and discontinued use of afo devices to allow for improved function of bilateral lower extremities . upon discharge , the patient demonstrated improved gait pattern with even stride length and diminished genu recurvatum , decreased pain with standing and walking , and improved activity tolerance for adls at home , school , and within the community . the findings of this case report suggest that an astym protocol can enhance the treatment of soft tissue restrictions , improve function in those with cerebral palsy , and ultimately provide improved quality of life . the results of this case study will be useful in future research for alternate and efficient interventions for the treatment of soft tissue dysfunction in individuals with cerebral palsy .',\n",

       " {'article': 'uterine inversion is shortly described as the indentation and depression of the fundic area extending downwards up to the different levels of the birth canal till the vaginal opening . it is a rare entity experienced in two different conditions ; namely , puerperal ( obstetric ) or non - puerperal ( gynecologic ) . non - puerperal inversion occurs less frequently limited to case reports and it is associated with the traction effect of mass lesions , mostly benign submucous myomas , attached to the fundus ( 1 , 2 ) . this report mainly presents the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings of a complete uterine inversion caused by a giant leiomyoma . a 47-year - old peri - menopausal woman presented with bilateral groin pain , inability to urinate , and bloody vaginal discharge . clinical vaginal examination revealed the presence of a large necrotic mass filling the whole vaginal tract . the transabdominal ultrasound examination showed a cervico - vaginal mass measuring 112  114 mm ( figure 1 ) that protruded from the uterine cavity with the distorted view of the uterus . after consultation , we considered the possibility of uterine inversion with an unknown nature of the accompanying mass and mri examination was ordered . mri confirmed a large heterogeneous signal intensity of well - defined submucosal fundal fibroid mass extending till vaginal opening and sinking of the uterine fundus getting close to the upper vagina . uterine anatomy was distorted as seen as  v shape  fundus in sagittal plane due to traction of the mass ( figure 2 ) . there was no evidence of adjacent organ involvement within the disease , nor lymph node enlargement . laboratory tests revealed serum hb : 10.1 g / dl , hematocrit : 30.9% , crp : 37.5 mg / l , fasting glucose : 86 mg / dl , ast : 29 u / l , alt : 26 primarily , we tried to take out the mass through the vagina , but it was not possible because of the size of the mass . both fallopian tubes and ovaries were in the pelvis and located outside the concavity of the inverted uterus . the mass was taken out via transverse uterine incision after depicting the myoma s pedicle . total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy was performed due to the patient s request before surgery . pathology report confirmed 12  12  10 cm sized leiomyoma including large ischemic necrotic areas ( figure 4 ) . non - puerperal uterine inversion is a rare condition that can be presented due to gravitational mass effect of tumors . rare causes include uterine tumors such as sarcomas , carcinomas and mostly benign conditions such as leiomyomas as in our case ( 1 , 2 ) . diagnosis of non - puerperal uterine inversion can be difficult as they may not present with common typical symptoms ( 3 ) . clinical differential diagnosis of uterine inversion is troublesome even if the fundal depression can be palpated on rectal examination because of rectal condition and its presence may be missed until the time of surgery . radiological evaluation is essential for differential diagnosis of the clinically examined mass and the uncommon symptoms . as in our case , it was difficult to differentiate the actual origin of the giant mass with sonography transvaginal clinical and sonographical examination was not possible . in transabdominal ultrasonography , the y shape fundal indentation and depressed longitudinal groove extending from the uterus to the center of the inverted portion in every case is not recognized ( 4 ) . mri is the best radiological modality not only for the correct diagnosis , but also to delineate the lesion with neighbor structures ( 5 ) . computed tomography is not used as the first line examination in such pelvic masses , but it can be an option in conditions that mri is not possible . standard pelvic mri protocol with axial and sagittal t2-weighted scans revealed v - shaped uterine cavity and an inverted uterine fundus , and the uterine fundus was lined by a hyperintense endometrium surrounded by a hyperintense rim layering  these images are the indicative signs for uterine inversion . as well as revealing the uterine inversion , magnetic resonance imaging can depict the stage of morphologic changes of the uterus , the origin , extension , signal , and contrast enhancement properties of the mass , and the accompanying features of lesion invasion and pathological status of the lymph nodes . a classification of genital inversion has been described and treatment of the inversion is suggested according to the stage and associated pathology . in stage 1 , inversion of the uterus is intrauterine ( incomplete ) and the fundus remains within the cavity ; stage 2 , complete inversion of the uterine fundus through the fibromuscular cervix ; stage 3 , total inversion ; the fundus protrudes through the vulva ; stage 4 , the vagina is also involved within total inversion . while stage 1 , repositioning of the fundus could be tried for treatment , for stages 2 - 4 , hysterectomy should be an option and should be discussed with the patient if childbearing is not an issue ( 6 , 7 ) . eventually , radiologic evaluation is the key for stage definition and pre - operative decision - making . ultrasonography is the first - line evaluation method and mri should be followed for insufficient and undetailed imaging as in our case . in the absence of a mass lesion , inversion is easily depicted in the transabdominal view . transvaginal approach can be used for more complex cases in the early stages of the disease . late stages of the disease and accompanying mass lesion to inversion often require mr imaging . in conclusion , although being a rare entity , uterine inversion associated with giant pelvic mass can be easily recognized radiologically . if inversion occurs along with a giant mass , necrosis , infection , and severe anemia are evident and should be treated to avoid complications . this condition has to be clearly visualized for preoperative planning and also diagnostic suspicion of a malignant uterine tumor should be excluded . in our case , mri was performed complementary to proper ultrasonographic evaluation . in this context , again , mri is a valuable problem - solving tool for preoperative diagnosis of uterine inversion .',\n",

       " {'article': 'tuberous sclerosis ( tsc ) can involve almost every organ systems with symptom triads of mental retardation ( mr ) , seizure and facial angiofibroma . it was previously assumed as a rare genetic disorder,1 ) but the incidence of tsc at birth is now reported 1 in 6,000.2 ) tsc is an autosomal dominant disorder involving mutations in tsc1/tsc2 genes , but two - thirds of tsc occur sporadically.3 ) this implies that a patient without a known familial history of tsc could be affected by this hereditary disease and warrants clinical attention not limited to certain pedigrees . for psychiatric comorbidities of tsc , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ; 3050% ) and autism ( 3050% ) were reported frequent.47 ) depression , anxiety , mr and aggressive behavior were also common.79 ) in contrast , manic or psychotic features in tsc have only been described in a number of case reports . to the best of our knowledge , we present the first case of a patient with tsc , resembling a schizoaffective disorder of bipolar type . after delineating and analyzing the case , review of relevant literature the therapeutic utility of aripiprazole and lamotrigine will also be discussed as management options in tsc . the patient was a 19-years - old female with a diagnosis of sporadic tsc made at the age of three after having multiple infantile spasms . she was on vigabatrin 1,500 mg for her recurrent myoclonic seizures ( 23 times / month ) throughout her childhood . her medical records stated intermittent auditory hallucinations during that period . at the age of 13 years , the patient stopped her antiepileptic against medical recommendation . following a seizure relapse at the age of 16 years topiramate 200 mg was started , but she again discontinued it arbitrarily after five months . facial angiofibromas developed at the age of 11 years . although her facial skin lesions became barely noticeable after multiple chemical skin peelings and laser therapies , she was continuously distressed with her appearance . to treat her depressed mood and social withdrawal , the patient received sertraline 50 mg and pimozide 1 mg at a private practice . viewing that she was not fully responsive to the treatment a brain magnetic resonance imaging , ordered at her first visit , showed multiple non - enhancing cortical tubers and calcifications in both lateral ventricles suggesting subependymal nodules ( fig . 1 ) . the intelligence test revealed borderline intellectual functioning ( full - scale intelligence quotient [ iq ] , 77 ; verbal iq , 83 ; performance iq , 73 ) . diagnosed with psychotic depression , venlafaxine after one month , risperidone was discontinued and venlafaxine was increased to 150 mg as the mood improved . due to hypomanic features emerged at month 3 , venlafaxine was discontinued and valproate 300 mg was added . the parents reported hallucinatory behaviors like silly smile and self - talking and their main complaints were irritability and neglect of self - care . the patient s refusal for foods prepared by her mother hinted presence of possible paranoid delusions . the thought contents were dissatisfaction and preoccupation with her appearance , and feelings of worthlessness . any forms of hallucinations were denied despite the reported history of hallucinatory behaviors . while no other laboratory tests showed abnormality , the urine pregnancy test at the admission was tested positive . after obstetric consultation , the false - positivity of the initial screening was confirmed . during the 5 days of drug - free period in ruling out pregnancy , worsening of manic symptoms occurred with the emergence of talkativeness and flight of ideas . as pregnancy was ruled out , aripiprazole 5 mg and valproate 600 mg were started . while increasing aripiprazole and valproate doses to 15 mg and 800 mg respectively , she began to complain akathisia . after one week of inpatient treatment , the manic symptoms improved but psychomotor retardation worsened and sudden weight gain of 3 kg occurred . to alleviate the aforementioned side effects , however , the manic symptoms worsened again after 2 days of valproate discontinuation . due to her aggravated hostility , subsequently , the patient s mood and auditory hallucination were improved , but the persecutory delusions persisted . while increasing lamotrigine as scheduled , aripiprazole was increased to 30 mg ( table 1 ) . during the admission , the patient repeatedly displayed negative perception of herself and others . altogether with inefficient social skills , they were evaluated as contributing factors to her mood symptoms and paranoia . therefore , brief cognitive therapy was carried out to improve the distorted self - images in addition to pharmacotherapy . after two successful overnight stay trials at home , she was finally discharged on 50th hospital day . the patient is now being followed up in the out - patients department for over 4 years without exacerbation , currently maintaining aripiprazole 15 mg and lamotrigine 200 mg . the institutional review board of the hospital approved this report after reviewing that no identifiable personal data were used and checking the presence of consent . written informed consent was obtained both from the patient and her father for case report ( irb no . despite the high psychiatric comorbidities , psychotic or bipolar features of tsc are little known . hence , it should be considered whether the symptoms are really caused by tsc . as such symptoms could also be caused by a pre - existing mood disorder , secondarily by a seizure disorder , or by antidepressants . however , we concluded that tsc itself directly caused the schizoaffective symptoms for the following reasons . first of all , no temporal relationship exists to support depression as a cause for the psychotic state . auditory hallucinations were stated on her medical record many years before the development of facial angiofibromas or depression . as the psychotic symptoms preceded her psychosocial stressor or depression , they can be hardly explained by a pre - existing mood disorder . in addition , the negative familial history of psychiatric illness and the extensive involvement of cortical tubers in the patient s brain all lessened the possibility of primary psychiatric disorder . secondly , the chance of a psychiatric disorder secondary to seizures , rather than tsc itself , was examined . because , about 10% of children with complex partial seizures were reported to have a schizophrenia - like psychosis.10 ) however , those children displayed poor seizure control . our patient remained seizure free for three years and her symptoms continued despite no abnormality was found on eeg . furthermore , positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions were associated in psychosis with seizures but negative symptoms were not.10 ) in contrast , our patient exhibited negative symptoms as well as positive symptoms for substantial period of time , irrespective of the mood status . thirdly , an antidepressant - induced mood switch was also considered . however , even after venlafaxine discontinuation for five months , the symptoms remained . moreover , after the initial stabilization in the absence of an antidepressant , the switch of mood stabilizer from valproate to lamotrigine sufficed the reemergence of manic symptoms . still , we believe that prescribing venlafaxine to tsc patients , whom might be more prone to bipolar disorder , should be done cautiously since venlafaxine was associated with more manic switches.11 ) the literature about psychotic or bipolar disorder in tsc is almost non - existent . whereas some numbers of cases were reported about psychotic symptoms , only six cases of tcs with mania were found in pubmed literature search until september 2015.1217 ) the prevalence for seizure , autism and mr are high in tsc with 85%,18 ) 3050%4,5 ) and 4264 % 9,12 ) respectively . moreover , those three disorders also demonstrated high comorbidity for psychosis.1921 ) therefore , tsc may also have an association with psychosis and warrants further investigations . the highly reported hyperactivity in tsc ( 56%),9 ) also raises the suspicion of under - diagnosed bipolarity . in tsc , adhd is also prevalent with reported prevalence of 3050%.4,6,7 ) considering that both adhd and autism have high comorbidity of bipolar disorder,22,23 ) tsc may also encompass high incidence of bipolar disorder . furthermore , chromosome 16p13.3 , where tsc 2 gene is located , was reported to have linkage evidence for bipolar affective disorder.24 ) therefore the risk of bipolarity should be properly assessed in tsc . the reason for relatively less attention given to psychotic or manic symptoms in tsc may lie in part due to the fact that pediatricians or neurologists , whom tsc patients usually encounter , are not familiar in diagnosing such disorders . in addition , mistaking negative symptom of social withdrawal as a symptom of autism or impulsivity / hallucinatory behaviors as behaviors stemming from mr might have underlain for the under - estimation . even though 90% of tsc patients display psychiatric problems in life , only 20% of those receive adequate evaluation and management.25 ) additionally to the under - diagnosis due to the overlapping symptoms , we hypothesize that the widespread use of anti - epileptics in tsc may have masked the underlying bipolarity . considering that the bipolar disorder is not a rare disorder , there is still a chance of co - incidental occurrence of tsc and bipolarity . still , anticonvulsants already prescribed for seizures might have a protective role against outburst of such manic episode . therefore , additional caution should be applied when evaluating tsc patients for mood and when anti - epileptics are decided to be discontinued in in tsc . as literatures on such conditions in addition to drawing more clinical attention to tsc , we would like to share our successful treatment experience with aripiprazole and lamotrigine . although manic symptoms were a major concern , the patient suffered most extensively from depression and psychomotor retardation . lamotrigine was chosen adjunctively to aripiprazole , as lamotrigine was effective in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder.26 ) nevertheless , safety and tolerability actually came first before effectiveness in mood stabilizer selection . however , the patient was not tolerant to valproate and lithium may increase the risk of seizure.27 ) moreover , lithium usage may become problematic if renal complications occur later by tsc , which is the most common cause of mortality in tsc.28 ) lamotrigine was chosen not only as a mood stabilizer , but also as a safe measure against possible seizure relapse in the future . in the literature , furthermore , vigabatrin may induce peripheral visual field defect in 2550% of exposed patients.29 ) topiramate may worsen cognitive functions,3032 ) which may negatively impact on already disadvantaged patient s intelligence . on the other hand , lamotrigine was not associated with cognitive impairment.33,34 ) the main purpose for prescribing aripiprazole was to mitigate both the psychotic and manic symptoms . aripiprazole has partial agonistic activities at dopamine d2 and serotonin 5-ht1a receptors , while also acting as an antagonist at serotonin 5-ht2a receptor . this unique receptor profile of aripiprazole provides some favorable advantages over other antipsychotics in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms , sedation , hyperprolactinemia , and metabolic side effects like weight gain.35 ) thus , aripiprazole was suggested to be both safe and effective for treating pediatric patients with bipolar disorders.35,36 ) improvement of cognitive function was reported in chronic schizophrenia after switching to aripiprazole.37 ) considering the high comorbid intellectual disabilities in tsc , as demonstrated by borderline intellectual funcioning in this case , aripiprazole may have additional value in cognitive domain over other antipsychotics . in addition to controlling psychotic or behavioral disturbances , aripiprazole can also be useful in dealing with highly prevalent depressive symptoms in tsc , as it is also indicated for adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder . in conclusion , while lamotrigine could be a good treatment option in tsc , a combination therapy with an antipsychotic like aripiprazole might be more useful in the acute phase considering the long required build - up time of lamotrigine . some promising clinical trial outcomes were reported with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.38 ) it should also be assessed whether tsc associated neuropsychiatric disorders ( tand ) could also be improved . even without a disease - modifying treatment option , psychiatric and related behavioral problems may still be managed effectively in tsc . delayed recognition and management of those problems put the tsc patients and their families in unnecessary suffering . furthermore , whenever encountering symptoms like fluctuation of mood , delusions , sudden changes of behavior , and vegetative functions occur , bipolar / psychotic spectrum disorder should also be evaluated .',\n",

saharan africa where the diagnostic gap is still close to 40% . we report a case of ddms in a nigerian with childhood - onset epilepsy and review the literature . a 27-year - old female presented to our clinic with her father because of recurrent seizures and poor scholastic performance . she had normal development until she was 2  years when she had a febrile seizure which was described as focal clonic involving the left side of the body . about 15  years prior to presentation , she developed recurrent generalized tonic - clonic seizures . she demonstrated impaired cognition and poor scholastic performance which prevented her from completing her secondary education . her general physical examination revealed a young female who was small for her age , with a weight of 43.7  kg and a height of 1.56  m ( body mass index , bmi  =  17.9  kg / m ) . her score on ravens standard progressive matrices ( rspm ) was 11/60 , indicating intellectual impairment ( below the 5th percentile for her age ) . neurologically , she had left facial hemiatrophy , left hemibody atrophy , and spastic hemiparesis ( power of 4/5 in both left upper and lower limbs with a left extensor plantar response . , we suspected rasmussen encephalitis and requested a cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and an electroencephalogram ( eeg ) . her brain mri ( see fig . 1 . ) revealed right cerebral hemiatrophy with features of encephalomalacia surrounded by gliosis ( figure ) . furthermore , on mri , she had right calvarium thickening and hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinus . her eeg revealed a low amplitude background over the right hemisphere with intermittent bursts of generalized sharp - and - slow wave complexes . these features place her in the ilae category of epilepsy with structural  metabolic causes . her seizure frequency has been reduced from  at least once a week  to  less than weekly but at least once a month  . the findings of cerebral hemiatrophy , calvarial thickening , and hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinuses on mri in the setting of drug - resistant seizure , intellectual impairment , and hemibody atrophy are the diagnostic criteria for ddms in this case . for epilepsy care givers , our case illustrates the fact that seizures associated with hemibody atrophy have a differential diagnosis beyond rasmussen 's syndrome . acute focal weakness following a seizure in a child has many serious and treatable causes . although benign etiologies such as todd 's paralysis and metabolic etiologies such as glucose , sodium , potassium , calcium , and magnesium abnormalities are easily identifiable , structural lesions such as neoplasms , intracerebral abscesses , acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , developmental brain malformations , and signs of trauma and vascular disorders such as ischemic and hemorrhagic infarctions should be excluded . hemiconvulsion - hemiplegia - epilepsy ( hhe ) syndrome should also be entertained . in hhe syndrome , neuroradiological studies may show unilateral edematous swelling of the ipsilateral hemisphere at the time of initial status epilepticus ( se ) . although neuroimaging studies were not conducted at the time of the initial insult in the presented case , the generalized tonic - clonic seizures after hemiconvulsions , which characterized this patient 's presentation , are less typical of hhe syndrome , which is characterized by hemiconvulsions alone . this is in addition to the long latency ( 10  years ) between the acute encephalopathy and the onset of epilepsy ( typically 2  months to 2  years in hhe ) , though the two syndromes have been recognized synonymously . other differential diagnoses should include sturge  weber syndrome , basal ganglia germinoma , silver  russel syndrome , fishman syndrome , and linear nevus sebaceous syndrome . in rasmussen 's syndrome , the calvarial changes are not found . basal ganglia germinoma presents with similar clinical features , but brain imaging reveals cystic areas , focal hemorrhages , and mild surrounding edema along with calvarial changes . in sturge  weber syndrome , brain imaging shows enhancing pial angiomas and cortical calcifications in addition to the clinical features of the phacomatosis . russell syndrome is characterized by the classical facial phenotype ( triangular face ; small , pointed chin ; broad forehead ; and thin , wide mouth ) , poor growth with delayed bone age , clinodactyly , hemihypertrophy with normal head circumference , and normal intelligence . fishman syndrome or encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome including unilateral cranial lipoma with lipodermoid of the eye , which usually presents with seizures . mims syndrome ) is characterized by a typical facial nevus , mental retardation , recurrent seizures , and hemimegaencephaly . the etiology of ddms is due to a cerebral insult that may occur in utero or early in life . the acquired type depends on the time of the insult and may be seen in adolescent or adults . in the congenital type , there is a midline shift towards the affected hemisphere , and the sulcal prominence replacing the gliotic tissue is absent . pattern ii corresponds to diffuse cortical atrophy coupled with a porencephalic cyst , while pattern iii corresponds to previous infarction with gliosis in the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) territory . the clinical profile and imaging features in our patient are in keeping with acquired ddms pattern iii . the mechanism of cerebral atrophy and the related progressive neurological deficit are posited to be due to ischemic episodes which reduce the production of brain - derived neurotrophic factors , which , in turn , lead to cerebral atrophy . in some cases , ddms is accompanied by crossed cerebro - cerebellar atrophy , which is thought to be a continuum of cerebro - cerebellar diaschisis . it has been postulated that frequent and excessive excitatory input during seizures via glutaminergic corticopontine  the 3  days of unconsciousness was due to either non - convulsive status epilepticus , a prolonged postictal state , or a coma of unknown etiology . the possible etiological association between ddms , prolonged febrile seizures , and middle cerebral artery stroke has been described . because of the high incidence ( 1118% )   of febrile seizures in our environment , with nearly 4% of patients going on to develop epilepsy , inappropriate management of febrile seizure should be highly discouraged to forestall untoward outcomes . medical treatment of ddms includes rational use of antiseizure drugs . if seizures are drug - resistant , they can be treated surgically with hemispherectomy , which has an 85% chance of rendering the patient seizure free . we could not offer hemispherectomy to our patient because epilepsy surgery and other tertiary care epilepsy management , including vagus nerve stimulation is still unavailable in our region of nigeria . currently , management of epilepsy is still limited to rational use of the antiseizure drugs . the relatively high cost of asds , on the background of high unemployment , poor remuneration , and out - of pocket payment for treatment , facilitates poor adherence to medications and widening of the treatment gap . efforts at rapid resolution of acute symptomatic seizures should be advanced to prevent untoward outcome . early diagnosis by an appropriate imaging study , optimization of medical management of the seizures , and enhancement of neurorehabilitation are equally important . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of ddms described in our environment in nigeria , although it has been described in other lower - middle income countries like iran , india , tunisia , and turkey . the paucity of neuroimaging facilities in our region may deter early recognition , and , therefore , a high clinical index of suspicion is required . we advocate prompt referral of patients with suspected ddms and refractory epilepsy to regional specialty care facilities in underserved countries to facilitate an early diagnosis and to provide optimal regional treatment .\",\n",

bearing age in vogue for the past three decades , there was no apparent effect on the number of pregnancies with ntds , possibly due to poor compliance apart from the unplanned pregnancies . to overcome this , folate fortification has been made mandatory in many countries and is being used in india also in a limited way . there is perceptible decrease in the incidence of ntds all over the world in recent years partly due to folate fortification programs . however , in india , this may have to be done with caution due to associated vitamin b12 deficiency getting aggravated after the correction of folate deficiency . in this regard , the role of naturally - occurring folate may be considered as an option if it is widely used in the food mainly in our country . this study showed high content of folate in coriander , a widely used green in indian food , and it needs further exploration .',\n",

this disease is rare in north america and europe but common in japan and southeast asia . although the cause of this disease is unclear , many case reports and studies have indicated that immunological abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of this form of vasculitis . numerous studies have suggested that immunological factors are involved in ulcerative colitis and that the coexistence of lupus erythematosus , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , and chronic hepatitis with ulcerative colitis is suggestive of an autoimmune phenomenon . moreover , many reports have described that genetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of the 2 diseases . however , occasional case reports have revealed an association between takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis , but the complicated coexistence of the 2 diseases might be rare . in this report , we describe a case of a 29-year - old japanese man with ulcerative colitis complicated by takayasu arteritis and present a genetic review of the pertinent literature on the serological analysis of human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) haplotypes in the patients with both takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis . a 29-year - old japanese man was admitted to our hospital in march 2007 for cardiovascular examination . the patient was experiencing diarrhea and bloody bowel discharge since he was at high school . at the age of 20 years subsequently , at the age of 24 years , when the patient was admitted to the hospital due to injury , he was diagnosed with takayasu arteritis at the same hospital unexpectedly . at the time of admission to our hospital , the patient was receiving predonisolone ( 20 mg / day ) and his body temperature was 36.5 , and blood pressure was 148/50 mmhg and 100/44 mmhg in the right and the left upper limbs , respectively . heart examination revealed levine grade iii / vi diastolic murmur at the right sternal border . vascular bruit was audible over the left subclavian artery , abdominal aorta , and both right and left carotid arteries . electrocardiogram revealed a heart rate of 70 beats / min , sinus rhythm , and left ventricular hypertrophy . the laboratory findings were as follows : hemoglobin level , 14.1 g / dl ; white blood cell count , 14600/mm with 76.2% neutrophils ; erythrocyte sedimentation rate , 3 mm/1 h , and 7 mm/2 h , and serum c - reactive protein level 0.2mg / dl . hepatic and renal functions , and immunoglobulin and serum complement levels were within the normal limits . anti - nuclear antibody , anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies , and rheumatoid factor were not detected . the level of brain natriuretic peptide was 42.6 pg / ml ( normal level , 20 pg / ml ) . contrast - enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed dilatation of the ascending aorta and stenosis of the left subclavian artery , descending aorta , and superior mesenteric artery with severe calcification of arterial wall ( figure 1 ) . transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve insufficiency ( figure 2 ) with mild left ventricular hypertrophy ( left ventricular end - diastolic diameter : 52 mm , end - systolic diameter : 31 mm , left ventricular ejection fraction measured by using modified simpson method : 68% , interventricular septum : 13 mm , posterior wall : 12 mm , left ventricular mass index 152 g / m ) . hla typing revealed demonstrated the following antigens : a11 , a24 , b52 , b62 , dr4 , and dr9 . the patient was discharged in may 2007 , and he has been in good health for the subsequent 2 years . the association between susceptibility to takayasu arteritis and hla haplotype was first reported in 1976 . naito et al . first reported the significant association of hla - b52 with takayasu disease . till date , hla - a24 , b52 , and dr 2 have been generally associated with japanese takayasu arteritis patients . the aforementioned haplotypes are more common in the orientals and are rarely found in the europeans , thus explaining the geographical distribution of takayasu arteritis . since the first report of association of hla haplotype with inflammatory bowel disease in 1972 , there have been some reports indicating the association between ulcerative colitis and hla haplotype . reported a significant association between ulcerative colitis and hla - b52 and dr 2 haplotypes in japanese populations . the coexistence of takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis has been reported occasionally , mostly in japan . few such cases have been reported in other areas of the world till date . to the best of our knowledge , results of hla typing have been reported only 22 cases until now [ 524 ] . the results of serological analysis of hla haplotypes of patients with takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis are presented in table 1 . nineteen patients were from japan , among whom 17 were females ; the average age of patients was 27 years . for locus a , 16 cases of 20 patients were positive for a24 or 9 ( 80% ) . for locus b , 20 cases of 22 patients were positive for b52 or 5 ( 91% ) . for locus dr , 14 cases of 17 patients were positive for dr2 ( 82% ) . in our study , although the pathological association of takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis is not clear , a common genetic basis of these 2 diseases has been speculated because of high frequency of specific hla alleles , namely , hla - a24 , b52 and dr 2 . interestingly , hla - a24-b52-dr2 haplotype is a characteristic of the japanese population ( 8.7% ) . thus , it appears that a genetic factor plays an important role in the pathogenesis of concomitant takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis . additionally , among these patients , takayasu arteritis followed the occurrence of ulcerative colitis in 15 cases of 21 patients ( 71% ) , ulcerative colitis tended to occur simultaneously or prior to the development of arteritis . these results suggest that takayasu arteritis is one of the complications of the extra intestinal tract of ulcerative colitis . there have been some reports on the association of clinical manifestations of takayasu arteritis and hla haplotypes . the incidence of aortic valve regurgitation in patients with takayasu arteritis is between 13% and 25% ; therefore , aortic valve regurgitation is now considered an important risk factor of mortality in patients with this disease . reported that the frequency of aortic valve regurgitation was markedly increased in hla - b52 positive patients ; further , b52 positive patients required higher dose of steroids for a longer periods as compared to b52 negative patients . also reported that the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was more common in b52 positive patients than in b52 negative takayasu arteritis patients . in these studies , it was concluded that b52 positive patients are affected more seriously and developed these complications more rapidly than b52 negative patients ( 28 ) . reported that aortic valve regurgitation , pulmonary infarction , and ischemic heart disease were commonly observed in b52 positive and b39 negative patients , and the incidence of renal artery stenosis was significantly high in b52 negative and b39 positive patients . similarly , futami et al . reported that hla - dr2 ( drb1 1502 ) was associated with the severity of the disease in patients with ulcerative colitis . therefore , hla haplotype was suggested to be important in the pathogenesis of takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis ; further , hla haplotype might determine not only the susceptibity of patients to takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis but also the clinical manifestation of these diseases . in patients with both takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis , high frequency of hla - a24 , b52 , and dr 2 is observed . the pathological relevance of hla - a24 , b52 , and dr2 to concomitant takayasu arteritis and ulcerative colitis requires further investigation . moreover , further studies are required to identify other genetic factors and environmental agents that contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases .',\n",

therefore , it can take longer to make the right diagnosis [ 3 , 4 ] . in case of radiological examination , mri is recommended before ct scan as it is more discerning in differentiating cervical and uterine lymphomas from other entities . the prognosis of the patient depends on the stage of the disease , the location and the subtype lymphoma . the ann arbor classification can be made based on findings on the ct scan and bone marrow biopsy . due to low incidence of primary uterine lymphoma large patient series describing the optimal treatment method are not available . in the scarce available literature it is recommended to treat with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy , chemotherapy , irradiation or a combination of these . r - chop chemotherapy was shown to improve 5-year survival rates significantly in patients over 60 years of age with diffuse large b - cell lymphoma [ 6 , 7 ] . no randomized controlled trials have been performed on the treatment of primary uterine lymphomas , nor are there treatment standards . therefore it is recommended to individualize the treatment for patients with primary lymphomas of the female genital tract . a primary uterine lymphoma is a rare malignancy of the female genital tract . because patients have often nonspecific symptoms , it usually takes longer before the correct diagnosis is made . no evidence - based advice is available for treatment due to its low incidence ;

old boy , born of nonconsanguineous marriage with normal developmental milestones , presented to us with extremely pruritic papulonodular lesions over bilateral shins , dorsum of feet , and nape of the neck for a duration of 5 years . the lesions first appeared over the shins and then on the dorsum of the feet . there was no past history of similar illness or any other significant medical or surgical history . there was no history of trauma -

like lesions over the arms and legs . the term  pemphigoid nodularis  was coined by yung et al . , in 1981 . they described a female patient of bp who , many years later , developed pruritic nodular lesions and subsequently diagnosed as pemphigoid nodularis . most of the patients of pemphigoid nodularis reported till date belonged to older age group . a single case of juvenile pemphigoid nodularis has been reported by ratnavel et al . who described a 15-year - old male presenting with bullous lesions and subsequently developed pruritic nodular lesions . the histological and immunological features of pemphigoid nodularis are those of classic bp , with added epidermal hyperkeratosis suggesting that pemphigoid nodularis is a variant of bp . most of the patients require systemic immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone , dapsone and azathioprine , cyclophosphamide either alone or in combination . although pemphigoid nodularis predominantly affects elderly women , it may present in younger age group also . here',\n",

hence , we were unable to trace contact history in the case described here . the patient did not have known comorbid risk factors ; hence , her clinical course was mild . epidemiologic clues to her diagnosis included residence in an area with the highest incidence of pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 in taiwan in 2011 and her naive immunity ( lacking vaccination or exposure to the pandemic 1918 strain ) . clinical clues supporting pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 infection include initial leukocytosis as opposed to leukopenia , relative lymphopenia , and initial false - negative rapid influenza diagnostic test ( 6 ) . only a few cases of pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 encephalitis in adults have ever been reported ( table a1 ) . the onset of neurologic symptoms usually occurs within a few days of influenza - like illness . unlike children , for whom the mortality rate can be as high as 30% ( 4 ) , initial neurologic severity parallels the severity of pulmonary disease and is predictive of neurologic outcomes . this case highlights the possibility that subtle neurologic deficits may lead to underrecognition of the milder spectrum of central nervous system ( cns ) complications associated with influenza . the patient s report of focal paresthesias and micturition difficulties ( in the absence of global neurocognitive defects ) understates the substantial , albeit transient , cns inflammation captured on serial csf and mri studies . mri patterns of cns inflammation in adults appear nonspecific , with t2 lesions distributed across both white and gray matter , with or without symmetry , brain necrosis , infarct , hemorrhage , edema , or ventriculitis . this patient may be the eldest and only female adult reported with pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 encephalitis . as observed , other adults were men from 20 to 40 years of age ( table a1 ) . there may be a yet unidentified genetic predisposition for influenza - related encephalopathy to develop among asians , as noted previously in children ( 4 ) ( and possibly among male adults ) . a remarkable feature of our case was the simultaneous cns detection of virus and pleocytosis , which suggests that the pathogenesis of subtype h1n1 encephalitis may not be simply due to immune activation or cytokine storm as current favored hypotheses propose but also may be caused by direct viral invasion . although we can not confirm the entry portal of the virus , we note that when the patient sought care , she had a peripheral cranial nerve deficit . influenza a virus has been detected in the csf of a small minority of japanese children ( especially in those with severe brain pathology ) ( 13 ) and in 1 teenager in south korea ( 14 ) . in children , pleocytosis has rarely been described , whereas in this adult series , mild pleocytosis appears not infrequently ( table a1 ) . despite the 2008 recommendation of the infectious diseases society of america regarding routine lumbar puncture in the management of encephalitis for survey of possible etiologic agents ( 15 ) , csf reverse transcription pcr for influenza is infrequently performed in adults ( table a1 ) . therefore , the role of viral cns invasion may be underestimated . in conclusion , physicians ( not just pediatricians ) should be alert to the possibility of neurologic disease due to pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 , especially in persons whose symptoms are subtle . further studies are warranted to clarify and confirm the neurotropism , particularly for persons of asian heritage , of pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 .',\n",

affected individuals . delayed diagnosis might be the most likely etiology behind the fatality of osteosarcoma in patients with paget s disease , .   linear growth of long bones takes place at the physis and epiphysis with the addition of new bone . growth displaces angulation away from the end of the bone , instead of decreasing the angle . the remodeling of angular deformity is primarily a response to functional stresses on the femur by muscle pull and the force of the gravity . angular deformities of the femoral shaft occur more frequently in fractures of the proximal third of the femoral shaft , often with medial angulation , and correct themselves more slowly in the proximal third than in the distal two thirds . patients with paget s disease of the bone ( pdb ) run a significantly increased risk of developing osteoarthritis .   the c - shaped medial meniscus covers 50% of the medial tibial plateau and has ligamentous attachments to the tibia through the coronary ligament and to the deep medial collateral ligament through the meniscotibial ligament . these attachments prevent the medial meniscus from translating more than 25 mm with knee motion . the medial and lateral meniscus share the load and reduce the contact stresses across the knee joint , transmitting 5070% of the load in extension and 8590% of the load in flexion . a 42-year - old woman was referred to our department because of pain in her left knee . clinical examination showed unusual craniofacial contour of a large skull with frontal bossing . decreased active and passive range of motion ( rom ) associated with relative left thigh palpation of the left knee showed joint line tenderness , and extensor mechanism pathology associated with mechanical blocking ( i.e. decrease in active and passive motion ) . squatting ( hyperflexion ) exacerbated the pain .   sagittal t1-weighted mri of the left knee showed no attachment of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus to the tibial plateau , but instead the meniscofemoral ligament ( ligament of wrisberg ) joined the posterior horn of the meniscus to the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle , i.e. discontinuity between the anterior and posterior horns , causing effectively the development of degenerative lesion of the posterior horn of the left medial meniscus ( figure 1 ( fig . weight bearing anteroposterior left lower limb radiograph showed varus deformity of the left lower extremity and narrowing of the medial knee joint and narrowing of the hip joint as well associated with unusual cortical thickening and bone enlargement . the angles of the frontal plane alignment were measured according to paley : mechanical lateral distal femoral angle ( mldfa ) = 106 , medial proximal tibial angle ( mmpta ) = 85 , and the distal tibial angle ( mldta ) = 93. these measurements were compared to weight bearing full length radiographs , which are considered to be the standard of reference for planning corrective surgery . the lateral distal left femoral angle measured 106 , which means approximately 20 deviation from the norms ( figure 2 ( fig . 2 ) ) . skull radiographs showed the cotton wool appearance , disorganized trabecular with areas of sclerosis which are poorly defined and fluffy . widening of the diploic space and relatively indistinct outer table , and the frontal sinuses are enlarged . these findings reflect the underlying pathologic changes of osteoblastic repair and are usually pathognomonic ( figure 3 ( fig . serum bone alkaline phosphatase was high ( four times greater than the normal value ) , which is reflective of the rapid new bone turnover . other laboratory studies showed normal levels of calcium , phosphate , pth and vitamin d levels . the patien underwent diagnostic arthroscopy of the left knee and mid -

virus infection of osteoclasts . khan et al .   investigated the hypothesis that dog ownership may increase the risk of paget s disease of bone by means of a case control study , led investigators to seek a viral etiology to the disease . evidence accrued for infection of the osteoclast by measels virus or canine distemper virus in patients with paget s disease of bone , with variable seeding of the osteoclasts in bone accounting for the distribution of the pagetic lesions in a given individual . this theory faltered as genetic probing of bone cells for evidence of transcripts of these viruses led to conflicting results , . genetic factors play an important role in pdb and mutations or polymorphisms and these have been identified in four genes that cause classical paget s disease and related syndromes . these include tnfrsf11a , which encodes rank , tnfrsf11b which encodes osteoprotegerin , vcp which encodes p97 , and sqstm1 which encodes p62 . all of these genes play a role in the rank - nfkappab signalling pathway and it is likely that the mutations predispose to pdb by disrupting normal signalling , leading to osteoclast activation , .   antiresorptive treatment suppresses bone turnover in paget s disease and improves the appearance of pagetic lesions on isotope bone scan , but the clinical evidence base only supports the use of antiresorptive drugs for the treatment of bone pain . bone pain in paget s disease can be managed either with simple analgesics and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs or with antiresorptive drugs such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates . interestingly , chung and keen   reported that with a single infusion of zoledronate , they were able to achieve clinical and biochemical remission in their patient with active paget s disease who had become resistant to pamidronate . buckler et al .   reported a dose -

deficiency due to repeated episodes of instability and its relative lack of mobility , . paget s disease is a progressive metabolic bone disorder which impairs bone metabolism by increasing bone resorption and formation . pain , fractures , and deformity of the long bones are among the most common clinical presentations . in our patient , the degenerative lesion of the posterior horn of the left medial meniscus was the prime clinical presentation . the varus deformity of the left femur caused mal - alignment of the axis with subsequent impaired distribution of force over the load - bearing left medial meniscus . in other words , in this patient , the varus knee correlated to more forces transmitted to the medial compartment leads to the development of osteoarthritis . finally , we stress on the necessity of phenotypic characterization as a baseline tool for the establishment of proper management .\",\n",

however , several recent reports have shown that coronary - subclavian artery steal syndrome is more common than initially appreciated . in a busy cardiothoracic program , approximately 2 to 4 cases per year may be found . this reflects an increased awareness of the problem and an advent of more effective diagnostic methods . treatment options of coronary - subclavian artery steal syndrome include aorto - subclavian artery bypass , carotid - subclavian artery bypass , percutaneous interventions for the subclavian stenosis , and transposition of the ita . in the present study , although some studies have suggested that performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for subclavian stenosis and using the ita for coronary revascularization could be an effective treatment in patients whose subclavian artery stenosis was diagnosed preoperatively , percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the lsca during the postoperative follow - up period may result in obstruction of the left ita by the stent itself , stent migration , or distal embolization . aorto - subclavian artery bypass or transposition of the ita seems beneficial in maintaining an adequate flow and long - term patency of the ita . these strategies require redo - sternotomy and increase the risks of surgery . therefore , we believe that carotid - subclavian artery bypass surgery may be an ideal treatment option for patients who develop postoperative coronary - subclavian artery steal syndrome due to progression of subclavian artery stenosis .',\n",

10 mm subxiphoid and 5 mm right upper quadrant ports which were the working ports . initially , we could not safely enter the abscess cavity safely with the hand instruments at our disposal ( we had two graspers , a maryland forceps and a needle holder ) because it was not close to the liver surface from the view of our o laparoscope . in order to avoid extensive trauma to the liver the veress needle was passed percutaneously ( on the suggestion of our engineer ) under direct vision from the right hypochondrium into the abscess cavity and 1500 ml of purulent fluid was aspirated . a peri - hepatic tube drain ( size 24 f chest tube ) two days postoperatively , fever and the abdominal pain have subsided dramatically . a repeat ultrasound done on postoperative day 3 showed that the abscess cavity has reduced to 5 cm . the tube drain was then removed and the patient was discharged home same day . at 3 weeks percutaneous drainage of liver abscess is the procedure of choice in the treatment of suppurative liver conditions . surgery is usually reserved for selected cases such as those in which percutaneous option has failed or patients with large multiloculated abscesses containing thick pus or when underlying surgical pathology requires operation . in this era of minimally invasive surgery , laparoscopic drainage of liver abscesses , combined with intravenous antibiotics , is a safe alternative for patients requiring surgical drainage when medical treatment has failed and in those with large abscesses . our patient would have had open surgical drainage , when the image - guided abscess aspiration failed . the approach we adopted avoided the increased trauma and the prolonged hospital stay that would have resulted there from . this would have been facilitated if we had a greater range of instruments , including articulated hand instruments , at our disposal . however , in the process we discovered that a veress needle can be an effective tool for percutaneous aspiration of liver abscess . veress needle [ figure 2 ] is a spring - loaded 2 mm caliber device with a variable length of between 8 and 12 cm , which is used primarily to achieve pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery . the veress needle is autoclavable and will be a cheaper alternative to standard disposable aspiration / drainage devices . certainly , under ultrasound guidance the needle can be passed into the cavity without the need for laparoscopy . it will also be more effective than the use of intravenous cannula ( which has been described in our region ) because of its bigger caliber and its longer length . drainage of liver abscess has also been done with laparoscopic trocar through which 28 french chest tube catheter was introduced . however the veress needle is less traumatic ; and when aspiration appears complete , drainage may not be routinely performed since there is often discomfort and morbidity associated with indwelling hepatic catheter . the duration of the procedure was unduly long because this was only the third laparoscopic surgery procedure we have been able to do in our hospital and we are not yet proficient in laparoscopic techniques . also our experience shows the importance of team work as it was the engineer that actually suggested the use of the veress needle . it is hoped that our efforts will also encourage other surgeons in our sub region to take greater interest in laparoscopic surgery . in conclusion , we suggest that the veress needle can be useful tool in the percutaneous aspiration of liver abscess .',\n",

reported involvement of extranasal sites such as oropharynx , larynx , trachea , bronchi , eye , ear , skin and genitourinary tract . there have been reports of rhinosporidiosis affecting the parotid duct resulting in cystic swellings of the face . we report a case of a 77  year old male patient from malappuram in kerala who presented with a swelling over the left cheek . the clinical differential diagnosis did not favour the possibility of rhinosporidiosis that was confirmed postoperatively by histopathological examination of the surgical specimen . this unusual case of rhinosporidiosis presenting as a subcutaneous cystic swelling left cheek adherant to the parotid duct not actually arising from it , is first of its kind and makes it imperative to think whether there is much more to explore about this disease and organism . furthermore our case emphasises the need for clinicians to be aware of such a possibility in endemic areas and to ascertain further facts regarding the pathogenesis of this disease . a 77  year old male from malappuram district of kerala ( southern india ) presented to our ent outpatient department with a swelling over the left cheek for one month . the swelling was small to begin with , approximately the size of a marble when he first noticed it . it then gradually increased in size with no alteration in size with meals and no history of pain or difficulty in mouth opening . he did not give any history of trauma , fever or dip baths i.e bathing in nearby ponds or any waterbody in the locality . on local examination a single , soft , discrete , mobile swelling approximately 4.5    3  cm on the left side of his face was noted . it was non tender with a smooth surface and the overlying skin appeared glossy without local warmth . the examination of the ear , nose , nasopharynx and systemic examination did not reveal any other abnormalities . the routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for a raised esr of 90  mm / h . screening tests including hiv testing done were negative . aspiration done in our procedure room revealed serous fluid which was sent for cytology and culture . cytology showed yeast forms / spores of fungi with acute inflammatory cells in background , suggestive of fungal infection and fungal culture was advised . the swelling reduced in size post procedure but within 2 weeks the patient came to the outpatient department with further increase in size of the swelling associated with pain fig . 1 . an ultrasonography done showed a hypoechoeic solid cystic lesion in the left cheek in the subcutaneous plane anterior to the masseter muscle with increased vascularity . contrast enhanced ct ( cect ) scan of the face was done which showed a well defined peripherally enhancing collection in the subcutaneous plane in the left cheek with no evidence of deep extension fig . was carried out which reported a possibility of rhinosporidiosis . in view of this a diagnostic nasal endoscopy was done to examine the entire nasal cavity and nasopharynx which were normal with no evidence of any lesion in these areas fig . the plan thereafter was a total excision of the lesion under general anaesthesia . in view of acquired valvular heart disease and high risk to undergo surgery under general anaesthesia a wide excision was done with careful clearance of the lesion from the peripheral branches of the facial nerve . a portion of the sac adherant to the parotid duct was separated meticulously and removed in toto . there have been reports of rhinosporidiosis of the parotid duct presenting as swelling of cheek but this case of a subcutaneous swelling of the cheek outside the parotid duct proper is a rare form of presentation of rhinosporidiosis ; a first of its kind to be reported . rhinosporidiosis caused by rhinosporidium seeberi is a chronic mucocutaneous infection endemic in south asia with largest number of cases reported in india and sri lanka . the life cycle and taxonomy of the causative agent , rhinosporidium seeberi , therefore this disease till date continues to be associated with diagnostic and treatment related challenges . the organism rhinosporidium seeberi was first described by seeber in 1900 in the nasal region in his doctoral thesis in medicine . initially thought to be a fungus , on further research it was considered to be a protozoan by seeber and a phycomycete by ashworth . an understanding of its life cycle and phylogeny has mostly been defined by observations in tissue culture , scanning electron microscopy and molecular studies . through phylogenetic analysis of rhinosporidium seeberi 18s rrna gene , this group of pathogens was originally identified by ragan et al . as part of the drip clade ( acronym derived from dermocystidum , rosette agent , ichthyophonus and psorospermium )   herr et al replaced rhinosporideacae with the term mesomycetozoa ( between fungi and animals ) . the class mesomycetozoa has two orders , that is , the dermocystida and the ichthyophonida . in the order dermocystida is the family rhinosporideaceae which includes rhinosporidium seeberi , dermocystidium spp . and the rosette agent . in the order ichthyophonida , the class ichthyophonae has members with phylogenetic features in common with the genus ichthyophonus and psorospermium . the most recent classification of r. seeberi is a eukaryotic pathogen in the mesomycetozoa class . the mature phenotype of the organism includes a thick walled spherical structure termed sporangium containing smaller spherical structures termed sporangiospores . microscopically , the involved tissue contains numerous sporangia ranging from 10 to 300  m in diameter in various stages of development with the larger lesions closer to the mucosal surface . the limitation of growing the organism in the culture media is responsible for poor understanding of the pathogenicity of the organism , . the common mode of spread of infection is by transepithelial transmission or autoinoculation and is thought to be mediated by exposure to spores present in contaminated dust , soil or stagnant water . owing to the natural aquatic habitat of the organism , a high incidence is reported in individuals who bathe in water contaminated by diseased cattle . but our patient had no history of bathing in ponds or stagnant waters and hence alternative mode of spread needed to be thought of . the pre - existing damage to the epithelium and poorly understood host factors have been implicated . in patients with rhinosporidiosis of the parotid duct , passage of the spores into the parotid duct through the natural patulous opening of the parotid duct from the oral cavity with subsequent replication has been thought to cause ductal stenosis and subsequently development of the cyst . in our case the spore had migrated from the parotid duct to the surrounding tissues resulting in subcutaneous cyst formation . this compels us to think on the possibility of the organism being motile or possessing the potential to migrate to adjacent tissues . hematogenous and lymphatic spread have been reported and thought to be responsible for the dissemination of the disease to anatomically unrelated sites . the lesion usually presents as a friable , polypoid , exophytic mass with submucosal studding of the erythematous surface with white dots giving it a  strawberry  like appearance . lesions may be associated with slow clinical progression and a prolonged incubation can be seen before initial exposure . a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary especially in patients who live in endemic areas and in patients with delayed presentation . the need for long term follow - up is also critical in this disorder given the potential for slow progression of a persistent disease . the primary treatment for rhinosporidiosis is wide surgical excision of lesion with cauterization of the base to promote the destruction of all spores . anatomic considerations of the surgical resection are based on the site of involvement . in rhinosporidiosis of parotid duct surgical excision along with ligation of the stensen duct in cases involving the parotid duct forms the mainstay but minimally invasive surgery together with dapsone a large cystic lesion was identified overlying the masseter muscle on the left which was dissected free from the branches of the facial nerve and a part of it adherant to the parotid duct was carefully separated ensuring total excision of the lesion . the complications of surgical therapy include recurrence at the primary or adjacent sites , bacterial superinfection and treatment related morbidity like injury to the surrounding critical neurovascular structures like the facial nerve in our case . the need for long term follow - up in this disease becomes important due to recurrences noted . in patients with high risk of recurrence the use of dapsone following surgery is suggested as it may stop the growth cycle of the sporangia and induce fibrosis of the surrounding stroma . the inability to establish experimental rhinosporidiosis and failure to propogate the organism in vitro , have prevented the determination of the sensitivity of r.seeberi to drugs that might have clinical application . while several anti - bacterial and anti - fungal drugs have been tested clinically , but unsuccessfully , the only drug which was found to have some anti - rhinosporidial effect is dapsone ( 4,4-diaminodiphenyl sulphone ) the role of dapsone is considered to be adjunctive in cases of incomplete surgical resection and in multi recurrent or disseminated disease or in involvement of critical structures . the difficulty in culturing the organism and its atypical cellular features have been responsible for its taxonomic enigma . the endemicity and rarity of this disease has further complicated matters with many questions related to it remaining unanswered to date . the organism is endemic to southeast asia and transmission are most commonly mediated by exposure to spores from contaminated dust , soil and water . the rare presentations of this disease as in our case reiterates the need to explore more on the pathogenesis . the primary treatment modality is surgical excision with cauterization of the base of the lesion . this could be challenging especially when the lesion abuts critical neurovascular structures like the facial nerve in our case . dapsone may be used as an adjunct to surgery , in recurrent and disseminated cases ; although its role is yet to be proven .',\n",

no brucellosis was confirmed . \\n although feral swine reside in oregon , none had recently been reported near the farm .   the case - patient s lack of exposure to feral swine and a known exposure to \\n commercial swine required further investigation . an epidemiologic investigation to \\n evaluate the commercial herd s infection status would require testing of swine on \\n the premises and related farms , and tasks such as tracing sales from the herd and \\n testing swine possibly exposed to swine brucellosis by temporary movement of boars to or \\n from farms for breeding purposes . such investigations can be costly , especially if there \\n has been extensive movement of swine in and out of the herd . whole - genome sequencing ( wgs ) and single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) analyses can \\n provide increased resolution to identify the source of infections without conducting \\n more expensive field investigations ( 4 ) . the national veterinary services laboratories ( nvsl ) had \\n implemented wgs and snp analysis as the primary means of genotyping b. \\n abortus and mycobacterium bovis isolates and applied this \\n information to identify sources of other outbreaks . although a project to sequence \\n b. suis isolates from animals of us origin was in process at the \\n time of this investigation , few had been sequenced . to rapidly investigate the case in \\n oregon , laboratory staff from the centers for disease control and prevention extracted \\n and provided dna from the isolate recovered from the oregon patient , and the nvsl \\n sequenced 59 b. suis biovar 1 isolates recovered from us - origin \\n animals . oregon was declared free of swine brucellosis in 1987 ( http://www.oregon.gov/oda/programs/animalhealthfeedslivestockid/animaldiseases/pages/animaldiseases.aspx ) , \\n and the nvsl did not have archived isolates from oregon or surrounding states . \\n consequently , isolates selected for sequencing were mostly from the southern united \\n states and had been recovered from domestic swine and cattle during 19932013 \\n ( technical appendix 1 ) . a few isolates \\n were selected from dogs , horses , and humans , all of whom , based on data from \\n epidemiologic investigations , likely had contact with feral swine . to obtain the whole - genome sequences , we sequenced b. suis dna on a \\n miseq instrument ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) using 2250 paired - end chemistry \\n and the nextera xt library preparation kit ( illumina ) , targeting 100% coverage . fastq \\n files from the instrument were put through the nvsl in - house analysis pipeline \\n ( https://github.com/usda-vs ) . reads were aligned to b. \\n suis isolate 1330 ( genbank reference sequence accession nos . nc_017250 and \\n nc_017251 ) by using bwa ( 5 ) and \\n samtools ( 6 ) . we processed bam \\n files ( 6 ) by using the genome \\n analysis toolkit best - practice workflow ( 7 ) . snps were called by using the unifiedgenotyper from \\n the toolkit , outputting snp to variant call files ( 79 ) . results were filtered by using a minimum phred \\n ( http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101 ) quality score ( scaled probability of \\n snp presence ) of 300 and allele count of  2 . from the variant call files , snps \\n gathered were output in 3 formats : an aligned fasta file ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blastcgihelp.shtml ) ; a tab - delimited \\n file with the position location and snps grouped and sorted ; and a phylogenetic tree \\n created by using raxml ( 10 ) . sequencing files were deposited in the \\n national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive ( sra ) under the \\n bioproject prjna251693 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=prjna251693 ( online \\n technical appendix 1 ) .   initially , as evidenced by the 60 isolates described , the united states could not be \\n ruled out as a source because of a lack of resolution . two approaches were considered to \\n improve the resolution of the b. suis database : sequence enough \\n isolates originating in the united states to assess the likelihood that any us - origin \\n isolate would closely match , or sequence isolates originating from tonga and determine \\n whether they were clustered with the isolate from the case - patient in oregon . the \\n difficulty in obtaining isolates from representative feral swine throughout the united \\n states precluded the first option as a viable solution . to obtain isolates from tonga , \\n we contacted the ministry of primary industries in new zealand for assistance ; its staff \\n members provided dna from 7 b. suis isolates recovered from patients \\n who were from tonga . new zealand is not known to have b. suis in its \\n feral or commercial swine populations ; therefore , humans with diagnoses of b. \\n suis had likely been infected in another country .   we constructed a maximum - likelihood phylogenetic tree comprising the oregon human \\n isolate , the 59 field isolates from the united states , and the 7 isolates from new \\n zealand recovered from patients from tonga ( figure ) . the branch labeled as outgroup_suis3 roots the phylogenetic tree , and \\n the a node is the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) for all isolates . without the perspective of the tonga isolates , a us source for this \\n isolate could not be ruled out because it shared the same mrca as 2 other lineages \\n occurring within the united states . origin isolates \\n clustered tightly with the oregon human isolate share a common ancestor at the b node . \\n the oregon human isolate is anchored by 2 additional common ancestors : c and d. in \\n addition to the phylogenetic tree , a table displaying divergent snps of closely related \\n isolates , including nucleotide calls and the positions within the genome , was created \\n for transparency and clarity ( technical \\n appendix 2 ) . often , 1 or 2 snp calls inform the epidemiology of a case . for \\n example , the 08 - 924 isolate recovered from a patient in tonga in 2008 has 1 additional \\n snp ( a thymine at position 1809039 on chromosome 2 ) from sharing a common ancestor with \\n the oregon isolate . maximum - likelihood phylogenetic tree of brucella suis isolates \\n from the united states and tonga . the phylogenetic tree was rooted using a \\n truncated b. suis biovar 3 isolate ( black text ) . green text indicates \\n the isolate recovered from the immigrant from tonga residing in oregon , b13 - 0219 , \\n and 7 additional isolates recovered from patients from tonga in new zealand . isolates recovered \\n from different animals within a herd are labeled with the same letter designation \\n after the species information . the letter a designates the common ancestor between \\n all isolates ; b , c , and d identify the common ancestors between the tonga and \\n oregon isolates . wgs and snp analysis effectively concluded that this case - patient was infected in tonga \\n and not by swine in the united states . thus , widespread testing of domestic swine was \\n not conducted ; agricultural trade continued without restrictions , and postexposure \\n treatment of contacts participating in home slaughter or meat preparation was not \\n needed . this case also demonstrates the value of and need for an international database \\n of validated wgs isolates that can be used by both human and animal health officials in \\n their respective and collaborative epidemiologic investigations . finally , this case \\n highlights the benefits of a one health ( http://onehealthinitiative.com/ ) approach between \\n public and animal health , including state , federal , and international authorities . technical appendix 1 . identification of the source of \\n brucella \\n suis infection of a human by comparison of host characteristics \\n and genetic sequences in samples from the human case - patient to those of animals \\n and humans in the united states and tonga . technical appendix 2 . divergent single - nucleotide polymorphism of \\n closely related isolates from persons the united states and tonga .',\n",

( b ) larvae - creamy white in color treatment plan was primarily aimed at encouraging the larvae to come out of the involved area . topical application of turpentine oil was done with autoclaved gauze soaked in it in order to asphyxiate the larvae . subsequent mechanical removal of maggots with blunt cotton pliers harvested approximately 55 - 65 maggots . these were preserved in 40% formaldehyde and identified as larvae of musca domestica or housefly [ figure 3b ] . oral drugs including doxycycline 100 mg bd on first day followed by od dose for next 5 days , metronidazole 400 mg tid for 5 days , ivermectin 3 mg bd for 5 days and diclofenac sodium 50 mg tid for 3 days along with a supplement of b - complex ( od ) for 15 days were prescribed . the patient was also advised to rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash 10 ml bd for 7 days . when the infection was under control , the mobile teeth were extracted and the wound was debrided in order to remove the necrotic tissue . finally , the involved site was re - examined for remaining larvae or tissue tabs before being sutured . the patient was educated and motivated with regards to personal hygiene measures with special emphasis on oral hygiene instructions . three week follow - up demonstrated satisfactory and uneventful healing with complete resolution of lesions . myiasis is an infestation of live human and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae that feed on the host 's dead and/or living tissues , liquid body substances or ingested food . it may take many forms including infection of the skin , gut , nasal cavities , eyes and occasionally the oral cavity . low socioeconomic status , immunocompromised state , debilitated and unhygienic living conditions are the main contributing factors . the risk factors include suppurative lesions , facial trauma , mouth - breathers , extraction wounds and fungating carcinomas . most cases reported in developing countries were due to poor personal hygiene and housing conditions superadded by a warm climate that aids the breeding of flies . in the present case , the patient was a farm laborer ( working in warm climate ) with low socioeconomic background and poor oral hygiene residing in a rural area . she was also in debilitated condition and had incompetent lips due to retruded chin and proclinated maxillary anteriors . primary myiasis is caused by biophagous larvae ( that feed on living tissues ) , which are common in cattle ( called bicheiras ) and are rare in humans . secondary myiasis is caused by the necrobiophagous flies ( that feed on the dead tissues ) which is the more common type and victims are patients with necrotic lesions . there are three forms depending on the condition of the involved tissues : \\n ( a)accidental myiasis  when larvae are ingested along with food.(b)semi - specific / facultative myiasis  when larvae are laid on necrotic tissues of the wound and(c)obligatory myiasis  in which larvae affect undamaged ( vital tissues ) skin . \\n  semi - specific / facultative myiasis  when larvae are laid on necrotic tissues of the wound and obligatory myiasis  in which larvae affect undamaged ( vital tissues ) skin . the present case was diagnosed as a rare case of primary or obligatory oral myiasis as the larvae fed on living oral tissues . in such cases , the adult female lays eggs on live mammals . the sites of infestation are usually superficial wounds , open sores and mucous membranes of any orifice such as mouth . these eggs are hatched within less than a week 's time depending on the external temperature . mechanical removal of larvae under local anesthesia is the traditional and time - tested treatment for cases infested with myiasis . local application of several substances such as oil of turpentine , mineral oil , ether , chloroform , ethyl chloride , mercuric chloride , creosote , saline , phenol , calomel , olive oil or iodoform can be used to ensure complete removal of all larvae . in the present case , diagnosis of oral myiasis caused by m. domestica larvae was based on the clinical appearance of the wriggling larvae as evident in figure 3b : whitish cylindrical body tapering towards its head ; head exhibiting a pair of dark hooks and raised posterior spiracles surrounded by an oval black border . the presence of cleavages in the maxillary vestibule and fetid odor further aided the diagnosis of oral myiasis . ivermectin was prescribed in order to block nerve impulses on the nerve ending through the release of gamma amino butyric acid , linking the receptors and causing palsy and death of the larvae . the well - known phrase ,  prevention is better than cure would be apt in the case of oral myiasis . prevention of human myiasis involves education and motivation including measures for control of fly populations and adaptation to general measures of cleanliness . these parasitic infestations can be reduced by raising the quality of life , providing good sanitation facilities and improving personal cleanliness measures as they rarely occur in healthy individuals .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath is most commonly found in the flexor aspect of hand and wrist and is rare in the foot and ankle . the mass was excised and intra - operative findings showed that the tumor came from the peroneus brevis tendon sheath . giant cell tumor , although rare , should be one of the differential diagnoses of tendon sheath tumor of the foot and ankle . giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath comprises approximately 1.6% of all soft - tissue tumors and is characteristically a benign peritendinous fibrous mass . there is debate as to whether the tumor is a true neoplasm or a pseudoneoplastic inflammatory response to soft - tissue trauma . this lesion arises from the synovium of the tendon sheath or synovial lining of joints or bursa and is characterized microscopically by synovial cells , histiocytes , multinucleated giant cells , inflammatory cells , macrophages , xanthoma cells , and collagen . grossly , it appears as a rubbery , multinodular , well - encapsulated , grayish tan , brown , orange , or yellow mass ; the color depends on the proportion of foam cells and degree of hemosiderin deposition . it is most commonly found in the flexor aspect of hand and wrist and is rare in the foot and ankle . in a study of 118 cases of giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath , only 4 cases ( 3.4% ) the mass was static in size till 2010 and then mass started to increase in size . clinical examination showed a 2cmx2 cm firm to hard mass over her right lateral heel ( fig 1 ) . magnetic resonance imaging showed a t1w intermediate , t2w heterogeneously hyperintense mass in the lateral aspect of her right foot , encasing the peroneal tendons . its long axis aligned with the course of the peroneal brevis tendon ( fig 2 ) . intra - operatively , a 3cmx2cmx2 cm multi - lobular yellowish mass was found encasing the peroneus brevis tendon midway between the lateral malleolus and the base of the fifth metararsal ( fig 3 ) . after excision of the mass together with the tendon sheaths of the peroneal tendons , the peroneus longus tendon was found to be displaced dorsally and rub over the peroneal tubercle with passive inversion of the foot . the peroneal tubercle was resected in order to prevent delayed tear of the peroneus longus tendon . histological examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath of the peroneus brevis ( fig 4 ) . upon 37 months of follow up , there was no local recurrence and the patient complained of mild tightness and discomfort over the operative site on walking . clinical photos showed a mass over the lateral side of the patient s right foot without any overlying skin change a t1w intermediate ( a ) , t2w heterogeneously hyperintense ( b ) mass in lateral aspect of right foot , encasing the peroneal tendons . c , d : its long axis aligns with the course of the tendon of the peroneal brevis with rim enhancement after contrast injection . b : retraction of the mass distally showed that the mass encased the peroneus brevis tendon sheath . d : the tendons were exposed after excision of the mass together with the tendon sheaths . hisological pictures of the tumour showed lobulated lesion composed of sheets of mononuclear cell associated with collagenous fibers . they possessed round to oval nuclei , small nucleoli and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm . giant cell tumour of the peroneal tendon sheath is rarely reported in the english literature . being rare in foot and ankle , it may sometimes mimic other lesions like lipoma , synovial sarcoma , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , synovial cyst and ganglion . hence , it is important to include this lesion in differential diagnoses especially if the lesion is presented as a slow - growing longitudinally oriented mass and found to be anchored to any of the surrounding tendons . characteristic mr imaging findings include the presence of fibrosis , which is manifested as areas of low signal intensity on all pulse sequences , and hemosiderin deposition , which results in blooming artifact on gradient echo images . the extent of the mass may be obscured by signal intensity similar to muscle on t1-weighted images . however , fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrate can result in varying degrees of enhancement as in our patient , which aids in defining the extent of the tumor . the differential diagnosis includes any soft - tissue mass with low signal intensity on both t1-weighted and t2-weighted images , such as a desmoid tumor ( particularly for a deep lesion ) or pigmented villonodular synovitis , which more commonly involves the larger joints . aside from possessing similar signal characteristics , actually , giant cell tumour of the tendon sheath is considered by some authors as the extra - articular counterpart of pigmented villonodular synovitis , arising from tendon sheaths , bursae or ligaments . other differential diagnoses include desmoid tumor , fibroma , cavernous hemangioma , ganglion cyst , granuloma , fibrosarcoma , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , synovial cell sarcoma , chondroma , granuloma , and tophaceous gout . local recurrence rate after excision of the giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath can be up to 45% . osseous involvement , radiologically evidenced by the presence of bony erosions is a risk factor for local recurrence . there has been no consensus regarding usage of any post - resection local adjuvants to prevent recurrence although curettage of the involved adjoining bony surfaces and treatment with hydrogen peroxide followed by thorough wash with normal saline and postoperative radiotherapy has been suggested [ 5 - 7 ] . in order to achieve complete excision of the tumor in this patient , the tendon sheaths of both the peroneus longus and brevis were excised together with the mass . it is advisable to perform the intra - operative inversion - eversion test to look for any subluxation of the peroneal tendons over the peroneal tubercle . if it is the case , the peroneal tubercle can be excised in order to avoid the postoperative symptomatic subluxation of the peroneus longus tendon and delayed tendon tear . giant cell tumor , although rare , should be one of the differential diagnosis of tendon sheath tumor of the foot and ankle . . the peroneal tubercle should be resected if the tendons are subluxable over the tubercle .',\n",

       " {'article': 'spinal cord infarction is a relatively rare condition and is caused by occlusion of the adamkiewicz artery . this is caused by conditions such as aortic dissection , atherosclerosis in the aorta , significant hypotension , and/or unexpected mechanical occlusion of spinal circulation after abdominal surgery.14 antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( aps ) is a rare condition . patients with this syndrome can present with both intravenous and intra - aortic thrombi ; however , intra - aortic thrombi seldom progress in a manner similar to atherosclerosis . intra - aortic thrombi have no symptoms unless embolic events occur and are detected by evaluation for embolic source by thoracic computed tomography ( ct ) or transesophageal echocardiography . a 74-year - old japanese man visited a nearby hospital because of pain in the right hypochondrium . he was admitted to the hospital and deprived of food , and antibiotics were given intravenously . his condition necessitated surgery ; thus , antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin and ticlopidine ) , which had been administered after percutaneous coronary intervention of the angina pectoris with bare metal stent 3 years previously , was discontinued . according to the japanese guideline heparin was not started when dual antiplatelet therapy was stopped.5 on the fourth day of admission to the hospital , a ct scan of the patient s abdomen revealed the following findings . first , no stone was found in the gall bladder ; thus , his condition was an acute nonobstructive cholecystitis . second , several diffuse and multiple contrast lucent masses were present in the descending aorta , which appeared to be atherosclerotic plaques . however , ct scans of descending aorta obtained 4 months before his admission exhibited no signs of contrast lucent masses such as atherosclerotic plaques . previous ct examination was evaluated for syncope and chest and back pain to rule out aortic dissection . furthermore , blood chemistry data , which exhibited a high level of fibrin degradation product ( fdp ) and d - dimer , suggested that these masses were multiple thrombi in an acute phase . therefore , he was transferred to our hospital for further study and therapy . on admission neurological examination revealed weakness of the lower extremities ( iliopsoas grade 3 , knee extension grade 4 , and upper arm grade 5 [ normal ] , according to american spinal injury association classification ) . there was also sensory disturbance under the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra ( th10 ) . emergency dynamic thoracoabdominal contrast - enhanced ct revealed a slight progression of the intra - aortic thrombi and occlusion of the anterior spinal cord artery at the diaphragmatic level , compared with the previous reading at his former hospital ( figures 1 and 2 ) . we administrated antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin and ticlopidine ) immediately and increased the dose of unfractionated heparin from 10,000 iu / day to 15,000 iu / day to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time of 49.2 seconds ( control 29.9 seconds , 1.65 times prolonged ) . after this treatment , his neurological symptoms did not progress . on the second day of admission to our hospital , percutaneous transhepatic gall bladder drainage ( ptgbd ) was performed . fdp and d - dimer values decreased on the next day of ptgbd , and we continued the antiplatelet treatment . on the third day , magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord revealed high intensity in the spinal cord from th9 to the first lumbar vertebra ( l1 ) on a diffusion - weighted image , as well as a t2-weighted image . magnetic resonance images supported the diagnosis of spinal cord infarction caused by anterior spinal artery occlusion ( figure 3 ) . heparin and antiplatelet medications were continued , and his laboratory data ( fdp and d - dimer ) improved stably ; therefore , additional anticoagulant therapy was deemed unnecessary . paralysis of both legs and the senses near the anus and the incomplete passage of stool improved gradually . on the tenth day twenty days after ptgbd , follow - up ct revealed regression of the intra - aortic thrombi . finally , he moved back to his former hospital to continue rehabilitation . spinal cord infarction is a rare condition , and systematic reviews on this condition are few.1 nearly two - thirds of spinal cord infarctions are caused by acute or chronic spinal disease.6 aortic dissection is one of the major causes of this condition ; however , the absolute number of patients with spinal cord infarction is low . aortic dissection rarely obstructs the adamkiewicz artery resulting in spinal cord infarction . in many cases , we were able to diagnose our patient as having early - phase spinal cord infarction due to arterial thrombi by the findings of previous and present ct images , laboratory data , and neurological examinations . previous studies have suggested that most lucent masses in the aorta observed by ct evaluation are atherosclerosis that has usually existed for a long period of time . thrombi rarely grow in high - flow areas such as in the arterial system . however , we observed a case of rapidly progressive multiple thrombi in the descending aorta resulting in spinal cord infarction . first , it was difficult to identify the contrast lucent masses in the patient s aorta as thrombi . they exhibited a similar appearance to atherosclerosis , and many physicians were unable to distinguish these masses . only with the contrast - enhanced ct images obtained 4 months before many previous studies have suggested that arterial thrombi are caused by many factors , including infection , blood coagulation abnormality , aps , and malignancy . infections such as cholecystitis or other infections with sepsis usually do not generate multiple thrombi in the aorta . the patient s thoracoabdominal ct did not reveal malignant tumors ; however , laboratory data upon admission to our hospital revealed aps , because his anticardiolipin antibody was positive . in this case , however , patients with this syndrome do not usually develop diffuse and severe intra - aortic thrombi , except in a few case reports of myocardial infarctions and strokes.7,8 we speculate that the sudden stopping of antiplatelet therapy might have caused arterial thrombi in this case . our patient was treated with warfarin and dual antiplatelets and had no complication of hemorrhage . following continuous rehabilitation he was able to stand up by himself with a holding rail . thus , we were able to successfully treat spinal cord infarction caused by rapidly progressive diffuse intra - aortic thrombus in a patient with acute nonobstructive cholecystitis . we successfully managed aortic thrombi resulting in spinal cord infarction associated with aps in a patient with acute cholecystitis .',\n",

based chemotherapy ( 3 ) . wernicke 's encephalopathy , an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that results from thiamine deficiency , has rarely been associated with 5-fu - treatment . here , we report a patient who developed imaging - documented wernicke 's encephalopathy following 5-fu - based chemotherapy and who recovered after stopping therapy . a 46-yr - old woman was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer 5 months before being admitted to our hospital for a course of chemotherapy . she had no history of chronic alcohol consumption or benzodiazepine addiction , or any other significant medical history including malnutrition , surgery or herbal medications . concurrent chemoradiation therapy was performed with cisplatin ( 100 mg / m at 3-week intervals ) . one month after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy , we gave her chemotherapy consisting of a continuous infusion of 5-fu 1,000 mg / m / day for 4 days and cisplatin 75 mg / m for 1 hr on the first day of each chemotherapy cycle at 3-week intervals . she experienced nci ctc ( v. 3.0 ) grade 2 stomatitis and grade 3 neutropenia during the first cycle , which resolved after supportive therapy . on the 20th day of the second round of chemotherapy with 5-fu and cisplatin , she experienced dizziness with nystagmus , but these symptoms resolved with conservative management . fifteen days after the dizziness episode , she showed acute onset disorientation , headache , and lethargy . her mental status showed confusion , but neither focal neurological signs nor pathological reflexes were noted . her blood pressure was 110/70 mmhg , pulse rate 110/min , respiratory rate 14/min , and body temperature 36.4. her myelosuppression status after chemotherapy was a white blood cell count of 1,300/l ( neutrophils 74.4% , lymphocytes 14.3% ) , hemoglobin concentration of 8.1 g / dl , and platelet count of 62,000/l . at that time , the level of serum bun and creatinine were 10 mg / dl and 0.6 mg / dl . the total protein was 5.8 g / dl ( reference range , 6.5 -

related , and is generally self - limiting . delayed toxicity appears several months later , is characterized as subacute multifocal leukoencephalopathy , is immune - mediated , and responds to corticosteroid treatment ( 3 , 4 ) . about 5% ( range , 0.6 - 7% ) of patients treated with 5-fu experience neurotoxicity ( 3 ) . in a study by yeh and cheng , wernicke 's encephalopathy is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms that may include changes in mental status , ocular abnormalities and motor problems such as uncoordinated gait and ataxia , but this triad of symptoms is seen in only 16% of patients ( 6 ) . wernicke 's encephalopathy can be caused by thiamine deficiency associated with chronic alcohol abuse , malnutrition or unbalanced nutrition , gastrointestinal surgery , recurrent vomiting , chronic diarrhea , systemic illness , or magnesium depletion , all of which can affect thiamine uptake and utilization ( 7 - 9 ) . wernicke 's encephalopathy can be diagnosed primarily from the clinical features , and it should be confirmed by symptomatic improvement with thiamine treatment ( 10 ) . mri is currently considered the most valuable method to confirm a diagnosis of wernicke 's encephalopathy . mri has a sensitivity of 53% and a high specificity of 93% , so it can be used to rule out other disorders . in wernicke 's encephalopathy , mri studies typically show an increased t2 signal that is bilaterally symmetrical in the paraventricular regions of the thalamus , the hypothalamus , mammillary bodies , the periaqueductal region , the floor of the fourth ventricle , and the midline cerebellum ( 6 ) . although the biochemical basis for the neurological toxicity of 5-fu is not fully understood , it may be related to blockade of the krebs cycle by fluoroacetate , a product of fluorouracil catabolism ; another possibility relates to thiamine deficiency . either possibility means that 5-fu - induced cns neurotoxicity can manifest as wernicke 's encephalopathy . thiamine phosphate is the active form of the vitamin , but its formation from thiamine can be blocked by 5-fu , an action that could further exacerbate preexisting thiamine deficiency in cancer patients ( 3 ) . prospectively followed 35 patients receiving 5-fu - based chemotherapy and treated thiamine - deficient patients with vitamin supplements ( 12 ) . historically , most 5-fu - associated neuropathies developed during 5-fu infusion or shortly after 5-fu completion . our patient developed wernicke 's encephalopathy after 5 weeks of initial 5-fu exposure , but at that time , the concentration of thiamine was not low , although this measurement is limited by a lack of specificity and technical difficulties ( 6 ) . the nutritional status of our patient was improving after several weeks , although her nutritional intake remained lower than normal because of mouth dryness induced by the previous concurrent chemoradiation of the head and neck cancer . it appears that the 5-fu could have caused the wernicke 's encephalopathy in our patient despite the small dietary deficiency , because she was not in severe malnutritional status judging from the total protein , albumin , triglyceride , and magnesium levels and her relatively improving appetite . a deficiency in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( dpd ) , the rate - limiting enzyme responsible for the catabolism of 5-fu , may be associated with this type of neurotoxicity , gastrointestinal toxicity , and myelosuppression ( 4 ) . we did not measure the dpd level in this patient , but the concurrent myelosuppression might reflect her low dpd level indirectly . in addition , cisplatin combined with 5-fu can induce neurotoxicity , but this complication manifests mainly as a peripheral sensory neuropathy , although it may occasionally induce encephalopathy with or without seizure ( 13 ) , and it has not been reported in relation to thiamine . our patient was given a higher dose of cisplatin in a previous concurrent chemoradiation stage , but this did not produce any neurological abnormality . we postulate that this patient had barely escaped the marginal thiamine deficiency during cancer and therapy , and the subsequent exposure to 5-fu aggravated the dietary imbalance and caused the encephalopathy . the clinical neurological symptoms and radiological abnormalities were reversed with adequate replacement of thiamine , which differs somewhat from traditional wernicke 's encephalopathy . some therapies for malignancy have induced wernicke 's encephalopathy caused by a lack of thiamine supplementation with total parenteral nutrition , fast - growing neoplastic cells , vomiting and poor appetite . moreover the use of specific chemotherapy agents such as 5-fu and ifosfamide can induce this neurological disorder ( 6 , 14 ) . thus , it is important to confirm the clinical suspicion of wernicke 's encephalopathy associated with thiamine deficiency in treating cancer patients . in conclusion , physicians should be aware of neurological signs in cancer patients treated with 5-fu , regardless of the cns involvement of the tumor , especially if the patient is at risk of dietary deficiency .\",\n",

ray evidence of sacral agenesis , anorectal and genitourinary anomalies , or other complex malformations of the caudal region . mri enables adequate diagnosis not only of the congenital anomalies of the spinal cord and spine , but also of most associated anomalies in the pelvic region . crs was first proposed as a clinical entity by duhamel in 1960 in a meeting of the british association of pediatric surgeons . sirenomelia is a rare and lethal congenital anomaly , caused by a disruptive vascular defect , characterized by fusion of the lower extremities , associated with bilateral renal agenesis , absence of the sacrum , rectum , and bladder . sirenomelia was formerly thought to be an extreme form of crs , but it is reclassified to be considered a separate entity . aside from fusion of the lower extremities , presence of single umblical , persistent vitelline artery is the chief distinguishing anatomic finding from crs . diversion of blood flow away from the caudal portion of the embryo through the abdominal umbilical artery/vascular steal  has been proposed as the primary mechanism leading to sirenomelia . in contrast , crs is hypothesized to arise from primary defect of caudal mesoderm . a teratogenic event during the gastrulation stage i.e. 3 gestational week , may interfere with the formation of notochord , resulting in abnormal development of caudal structures . altered oxidative metabolism from maternal diabetes may cause increased production of free oxygen radicals in the developing embryo , which may be teratogenic . based on position of conus , pang , divided patients into two groups : \\n group 1 : conus ends cephalic to the lower border of l1 vertebrae . in these patients , sacral deficit is large ending at or above s1 vertebrae.group 2 : conus ends caudal to the lower border of l1 vertebrae . in these patients , sacrum tends to be well -

functioning and pain - evoking . in addition , we believed that insertion of a new agv into the same place might predispose the patient to a recurrence of exposure . under peribulbar anesthesia , a conjunctival peritomy was performed alongside the area of transconjunctival tube erosion , and the tube of the agv was removed from the anterior chamber . to seal the space previously occupied by the tube , 11 bard - parker blade and a weckcel sponge . a piece of processed pericardium ( tutoplast ) , measured 1 mm in width , was then plugged into the fistula . the pericardium was trimmed flush to the external opening and secured with two interrupted 10 - 0 nylon sutures ( fig . for implantation of a new agv , a fornix - based incision was made through the conjunctiva and the tennon 's capsule at the superonasal quadrant . a pocket was created between the superior rectus and the medial rectus muscles by blunt dissection of the tennon 's capsule from the episclera . a new valve body was inserted into the pocket with its leading edges 8 mm posterior to the limbus . the tube of the valve was trimmed to permit a 2 mm insertion into the anterior chamber . a paracentesis was performed , and the anterior chamber was entered at the limbus with a sharp 23 g needle , parallel to the iris . the tube was secured to the sclera with two 10 - 0 nylon sutures , and covered with pericardium ( tutoplast ) . the conjunctiva and the tennon 's capsule were closed with 10 - 0 nylon sutures . the iop ranged from 8 to 20 mmhg during the postoperative one month . at postoperative 14 months , iop was 18 mm hg and no fistula - related complication such as wound dehiscence or pericardium melting was noted . case 2 : a 61-year - old man with diabetes mellitus , hypertension and nvg ( le ) had undergone agv implantation ( le ) 19 months prior to its explantation . at 4 months postoperative , exposure of the agv tube was noted . except for mild hyperemia around the exposed tube , no significant inflammatory sign was noted in the anterior chamber or around the tube . however , the cataract of his left eye worsened enough to preclude a view of the fundus . nineteen months after the agv implantation , phacoemulsification , posterior chamber lens ( pcl ) implantation , agv explantation and trabeculectomy with an intraoperative application of mitomycin - c ( 0.2 mg / ml for 2 minutes ) were performed concurrently on his left eye . the iop ranged from 9 to 23 mmhg during the early postoperative 3 months . at the latest follow - up at postoperative 23 months , the iop was 13 mm hg and no fistula - related complication was found ( fig . 3 ) . case 3 : a 56-year - old diabetic man who had undergone pars plana vitrectomy , phacoemulsification , pcl implantation and agv implantation ( le ) complained of ocular pain at postoperative 2 years . the patient was immediately treated with a topical fluoroquinolone ( ciprofloxacin ) hourly for presumed endophthalmitis . the next day the agv was explanted using the aforementioned method . with topical antibiotics , however , at the postoperative day one , the iop went up to the 40s . diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was performed to control iop . at postoperative 12 months , and 4 ) . case 4 : a 17-year - old man , who had undergone trabeculotomy , trabeculectomy and agv implantation ( le ) for congenital glaucoma , underwent a second agv implantation ( le ) . explantation of the second agv was performed using the pericardial plug in the aforementioned manner . the next day after the surgery two hypotensive medications ( cosopt and alphagan - p ) were added postoperatively . during the postoperative 26 months , the anterior segment remained stable with iop under control . it is estimated that 2~7% of patients undergoing gdis procedure develop melting of the overlying scleral or pericardial patch with erosion of the tube through the conjunctiva.8 - 13 possible causes of conjunctival erosion include mechanical abrasion of the conjunctiva by the lid , excessive conjunctival tension over the tube , tube malposition , or lack of a smooth and tapered surface between the patch graft and the host along with poor ocular lubrication.10 patch grafts like sclera , fascia lata , or dura mater may thin or disappear after implantation , secondary to ocular inflammation or a host - graft reaction.10 pericardial patch grafts , which are supposed to be cell - free and without any antigenic stimuli , have also been reported to melt.4,10 management of the exposed tube includes conjunctival autograft , scleral patch graft , amniotic membrane patch graft , and removal of the tube.3 - 6 if the tube exposure is accompanied by the infectious inflammatory signs which do not respond to antibiotics , the tube and the valve plate should be removed to help stop the propagation of the infectious process and prevent the subsequent development of endophthalmitis . although the explantation of a gdis is a simple procedure , it leaves an opening in the cornea and sclera that may not self - seal . if the gdis has been implanted for a long period of time , it can be difficult to close the fistula which has been occupied by the tube.7 mere direct sutures may close the defect . however , this would require a great amount of tissue tension and thus induce a significant amount of astigmatism which may be bothersome to an eye with good visual potential . even if the fistula is sealed tight initially , there is still a chance that the fistula may recur later and lead to aqueous leakage if the suture is not strong enough to withstand the tissue tension . therefore , tissue replacement may be an effective method to seal off the fistula , because it induces much less astigmatism postoperatively . since the pericardium is highly biocompatible and provides an immediate and permanent seal , we used a pericardial plug to replace the corneoscleral fistula when explanting the agv in all four of our cases . since sibayan et al.7 first description of this surgical technique , there has been no published report of utilization of this method and its postoperative results . in sibayan our present study demonstrates the postoperative results of four cases that were followed up for a longer period . no fistula - related complication such as wound inflammation , leakage , or pericardium melting has been noted in any of our cases till the latest postoperative follow - up ranging from 12 to 26 months . although the number of cases in our study is fairly small and the follow - up period is still short to verify the efficacy and stability of the method , the preliminary data of our cases may give support to the use of pericardium plug in such aforementioned conditions . in conclusion , the pericardium plug seems to be an effective method in the repair of corneoscleral fistulas resulting from explantation of glaucoma valve implants . however , a prospective study of a larger number of cases with a long - term follow - up will be needed to ensure the stability of this method .\",\n",

expandable metallic stent ( sems ) and confirm the efficacy of stenting for intractable malignant hemorrhage from unresectable duodenal cancer . upper gi endoscopy revealed a tumor in the third portion of the duodenum , which was diagnosed as duodenal adenocarcinoma by histopathology of the biopsied specimen . because computerized tomography showed the duodenal cancer with swelling of regional lymph nodes but without distant metastases ( fig . although we planned to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy , we gave up on the planned operation after exploration around the tumor because extensive invasion to the superior mesenteric vein was confirmed . we completed the surgery after performing stomach - partitioning gastrojejunostomy to prevent possible malignant obstruction and hemorrhage in the future . after the surgery , the patient underwent dcs ( docetaxel , cisplatin , and s-1 ) therapy as first - line chemotherapy according to that recommended for gastric cancer , and the state of the disease continued to be stable without distant metastasis and local progression after sixteen courses of therapy . one year and 4 months after initiation of chemotherapy , because hematochezia and mild syncope appeared and the laboratory data showed severe anemia ( hemoglobin 5.5 g / dl ) , he was suspected to be suffering from gi bleeding and was admitted to the hospital urgently . endoscopic hemostasis techniques , such as hypertonic saline epinephrine solution and argon plasma coagulation , were unsuccessful because the exact location of the bleeding could not be identified . intermittent bleeding persisted every 4 to 5 days and was treated by a blood transfusion each time . twenty days after the first emergence of the hemorrhage , a partially covered sems ( niti - s pyloric & duodenal combi stent , 10.5 fr , 20  10 mm , taewoong medical ) was inserted and placed over the lesion ( fig . 3 ) , exerting hemostasis by applying pressure on the tumor surface . soon after the placement of the stent , anemia progression stopped and hematochezia disappeared . thereafter , chemotherapy was continued for about 10 months without any sign of recurrent hemorrhage or migration of the stent . placement of a stent is performed for obstruction of the gi tract from the esophagus   and stomach   to the colorectal region , and a clinical practice guideline on this use has already been published . the indication for a stent has been extended not only to malignant obstruction but also to treatment for benign stenosis and postoperative leakage . it is also applied as bridging therapy to radical surgery   because it can relieve malnutrition from a long - term fasting state during placement of an ileus tube , and avoid an urgent colostomy under high - risk conditions , which contributes to diminishing the incidence of colostomy during radical colectomy and reducing postoperative infectious complications . for obstruction of the gi tract although historically plastic stents , made of rigid polyvinyl , were used for gi obstructions , both morbidity and mortality after insertion of plastic stents are higher than after sems placement because traumatic dilation of the stenotic portion is sometimes required before placement of a plastic stent that has a fixed diameter . consequently , plastic stents have rarely been used since the 1990s when uncovered sems first became available . sems are generally packaged in a compressed form and constrained around a delivery device , making dilation unnecessary and reducing the risks of perforation , obstruction , or migration , which can occur with plastic stents . because of the uncovered structure of sems when they were first introduced , the open mesh architecture caused tumor ingrowth and re - occlusion in 14% of cases . a covered sems was developed to overcome this disadvantage . in their meta - analysis , reported that the occlusion rate was 8.6% , which was significantly lower than that of uncovered sems at 21.7% . however , covered sems migrate more frequently than uncovered sems ( 18.3 vs. 4.1% , respectively ) because covering the outer surface of sems may prevent the mesh from embedding into the surrounding tissue . the effect of both stents is equal in palliative treatment of malignant obstruction of the gi tract , so it is necessary to select one depending on the clinical situation . it is almost impossible to find any reports about stenting treatments for malignant gi hemorrhage , although there are some positive reports about refractory bleeding after endoscopic varicose vein ligation and sclerotherapy for esophageal bleeding . , was a hemorrhage from a duodenal cancer with multiple liver metastases , and the other , by d'souza et al . , was uncontrollable refractory bleeding from a duodenal bulb lesion invaded by local recurrence of post - hepatectomized hepatocellular carcinoma . both cases succeeded in hemostasis by placement of covered sems . in this presented case , a covered sems was placed , as in the former two cases , in order to cease the malignant hemorrhage from a duodenal cancer . a stomach - partitioning gastrojejunostomy bypass , which results in the structure passing very little food , is supposed to contribute to the prevention of stent migration . a patient with uncontrollable and refractory malignant hemorrhage from the third portion of the duodenum acquired a better clinical course by the placement of a covered sems . although stenting treatment for malignant hemorrhage of the gi tract is still not common , it is a reasonable procedure that compresses a wide bleeding lesion in a plane , and it may become one of the most effective treatments for malignant gi hemorrhage . the subject gave his informed consent , and the ethics committee of showa inan general hospital approved the study protocol .\",\n",

human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) and minor hla antibodies may be implicated [ 3 , 4 ] . hla - c was identified in 1970 as a class 1 gene product which could induce an alloantibody response . historically , hla - c antibody was not considered to be an important factor in amr , but its role in humoral sensitization is now recognized [ 6 , 7 ] . in this context , we present a patient with biopsy features of amr , who on additional testing had hla - cw17 dsa . a 42-year - old male with end - stage renal disease due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis received a single antigen - matched deceased kidney allograft transplant . pre - transplant t- and b - cell complement - dependent cytotoxicity crossmatches were negative . he subsequently underwent induction with alemtuzumab and his immunosuppressive regimen included prednisone , cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil ( mmf ) . his baseline serum creatinine ( scr ) post - transplant varied from 1.6 to 2.0 mg / dl ( 122153 twenty - one months after the transplant , the patient presented to a local facility with complaints of malaise , fatigue and chest pain and was found to be in acute renal failure with an scr of 3.2 mg / dl ( 244 mol / l ) . prior to this presentation , the patient had been lost to follow - up for 9 months . he was empirically started on high - dose steroids for concerns of cell - mediated rejection . on hospital day 2 , he underwent a renal allograft biopsy . the clinical and histological findings were consistent with an acute amr as established by the banff criteria [ 8 , 9 ] . at the most recent banff meeting , the role of c4d - negative amr in kidney transplants was also acknowledged . the patient had no detectable dsa to hla - a , -b and -dr using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay on day 1 of his hospital admission for acute renal failure . in light of the fact that renal biopsy was highly suggestive of amr , additional testing using the luminex single - antigen bead ( sab ) assay was performed ( for class i and class ii antigens ) on the serum samples from day 1 and day 2 of the current admission . antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class i  related chain a ( mica ) were negative . the only dsa detected using the luminex sab was against hla - cw17 with a mean fluorescent intensity of 5500 . for further confirmation , a mock flow crossmatch was done using harvested lymphocytes from a randomly selected hla - cw17-positive patient ( see table 1 ) . this crossmatch was performed on three post - rejection serum samples from the patient ( samples collected on days 1 , 2 and 5 ) . all three post - rejection samples were positive for b - cell crossmatch but negative for t - cell crossmatch . in this mock crossmatch , specificity of the dsa was again confirmed to be against cw17 antigen using luminex sab . hla phenotype of the donor , recipient and mock donor \\n  the patient completed five sessions of plasmapheresis followed by intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) infusions as per our institution 's protocol over a period of 14 days . his serum creatinine reached a peak of 4.1 mg / dl ( 313 mol / l ) 4 days after his hospitalization and subsequently returned to 2.7 mg / dl ( 206 mol / l ) after plasmapheresis and ivig . after completing the treatment protocol , the patient 's new baseline creatinine has remained 3.03.5 mg / dl ( 229267 mol / l ) on an immunosuppressive regimen of prednisone , mmf and tacrolimus . antibodies to major hla class i ( a and b ) and class ii ( dr ) are thought to be responsible for the majority of the cases of amr . minor hla and non - hla antibodies have been implicated in some cases of amr [ 3 , 4 ] . hla - c dsa is not routinely checked in clinical practice and is not thought to be of importance in the pathogenesis of amr in renal transplant patients . hla - c - presented antigens , however , are recognized by cytotoxic t lymphocytes [ 12 , 13 ] . in addition , an hla - c locus has been shown to induce an antibody response similar to the other routinely checked loci . the clinical significance of hla - c antibodies has been unclear in kidney transplantation with only two reported cases of amr caused by donor - directed hla - c antibodies [ 15 , 16 ] . frohn et al .   in 2001 published a retrospective analysis , which suggested the influence of hla - c mismatch in acute renal rejection . in this study , hla - c mismatch significantly correlated with acute renal transplant rejection in pairs with one additional mismatch on the b locus . influence of hla - c has also been examined in bone marrow transplantation where it turns out to be a greater predictor of graft versus host disease compared to hla - a and -b . earlier serological typing for hla - c was considered less reliable than other hla antigens . polymerase chain reaction kits are now commercially available , which can type the hla - c loci accurately . also , with the availability of flow cytometric assays and antigen - coated bead assays , hla - c antibodies can be identified with increased sensitivity which may allow us to elucidate their potential role in the pathogenesis of amr . in our patient , all three post - rejection serum samples had positive b - cell crossmatch , while t - cell crossmatch was negative . it could be that the b - cell crossmatch is more sensitive at detecting anti - hla - c antibodies or it could be that non - hla antibodies whose target antigens are expressed on b cells may have been involved . it is difficult to establish whether the dsa detected against the cw17 antigen in this case were preformed or de novo as pre - transplant serum samples were not available for analysis . this case highlights that in certain cases of amr with no detectable dsa by standard testing , antibodies to non - typical antigens such as hla - c may play an important role . furthermore , it stresses the importance of including the hla - c in donor typing and antibody analysis in sensitized prospective recipients .\",\n",

( 2 ) type ii ( 6% of gastric nets ) , associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men1 ) and zollinger - ellison syndrome ( zes ) , and ( 3 ) type iii , sporadic ( 13% of gastric nets ) , not associated with a - cag or men1/zes . of the three types of ecl cell nets , type i and type ii tumours are invariably associated with ecl cell hyperplasia   and hypergastrinaemia , resulting from a secondary response to antral gastrin cells to achlorydria in type i and from unregulated hormone release by a gastrinoma in type ii . they are usually single lesions and often display more aggressive features than type i and type ii tumours . due to the difference in behaviour between the three types of nets , type i and type ii tumours are considered as neuroendocrine neoplasms , whilst type iii tumours are mostly neuroendocrine carcinomas ( necs ) . recently , to include all poorly differentiated gastric nets which consist of other than ecl gastric endocrine cells ( serotonin or gastrin producing ) and also a very rare type of gastric malignancies , the mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas ( manecs ) , another type ,  type iv gastric net , has been suggested . due to their rarity , our knowledge of gastric manecs is limited and mainly based on a small series of patients and case reports . manecs are a special type of tumour , characterised by an intimate mixture of two histologically different tumours , a nec and a gland - forming carcinoma ( adenocarcinoma ) . , we report an interesting case of a gastric manec composed of a nec and an exocrine component with two different cell differentiations including a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma , of which only the nec component has metastasised to the liver . we report the case of an 81-year - old man who presented 4 months earlier to his local hospital with right hypochondrial pain , palpitations , diarrhoea up to 10 times daily , nausea , anorexia and weight loss . an ultrasound - guided fine needle aspiration of one of these lesions was reported as  metastasis from net. common tumour markers ( cea , ca 19 - 9 ) were not elevated . an f - fdg - pet scan revealed hypermetabolic areas in the liver , para - oesophageal , porta hepatis and para - aortic regions . , he was treated aggressively for acute kidney injury due to dehydration and underwent a noncontrast staging ct scan of his chest , abdomen and pelvis . the scan showed a gastric tumour with hepatic , intra - abdominal and left supraclavicular lymph node metastases . for further evaluation of the gastric lesion , the patient went on to have oesophagogastroduodenoscopy which revealed a large ulcerating malignant - looking mass in the antrum of the stomach ( fig . manec with a small area of squamous differentiation. neuroendocrine markers for chromogranin and synaptophysin were positive in the neuroendocrine component only and negative in the exocrine component of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma ( fig . the tumour mitotic index was 52 mitoses per 10 high - power fields , and the ki67 was 65% . pmol / l ) , and the urine 5-hiaa level was 30 mol / day ( normal level 042 mol / day ) . in light of the neuroendocrine component , the patient underwent indium-111 pentetreotide scinitgraphy ( octreoscan ) , which showed avid uptake in the hepatic lesions , stomach and in a para - renal lymph node ( fig . however , due to his other comorbidities and poor performance status , he was commenced only on long - acting somatostatin analogues and best supportive / palliative treatment . following this , most of them arise in the appendix , but they also occur in the colon , stomach , oesophagus , duodenum and gallbladder . the association of the two components can vary in a spectrum ranging from nonendocrine neoplasms  either adenomas or carcinomas  with interspersed neuroendocrine cells to truly composite / mixed tumours showing an intimate mixture of neuroendocrine and exocrine tumour aggregates and to collision tumours in which the neuroendocrine neoplasm / carcinoma and the adenoma / adenocarcinoma are closely juxtaposed but not admixed . reclassified mixed endocrine and nonendocrine epithelial tumours by dividing the tumours into six categories : ( 1 ) neuroendocrine cells interspersed within carcinomas ; ( 2 ) carcinoids ( nets ) with interspersed nonendocrine cells ; ( 3 ) composite glandular - neuroendocrine cell carcinomas containing areas of carcinoid and conventional carcinomas ; ( 4 ) collision tumours in which nets and conventional carcinomas are closely juxtaposed but not admixed ; ( 5 ) amphicrine tumours predominantly composed of cells exhibiting concurrent neuroendocrine and nonendocrine differentiation , and ( 6 ) combinations of the previous types . according to the world health organisation classification of tumours of the digestive system , tumours can be classified as truly mixed only if both components are present in significant proportions  at least 30% of either component should be identified to qualify for this definition . in 2010 , gastric manecs are rare and usually described to be composed of an exocrine component represented by an adenocarcinoma with a variable grade of differentiation and a neuroendocrine component usually represented by a nec and rarely a net . the case reported here is a peculiar manec , displaying a trilineage cell differentiation including a nec , an adenocarcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma ( fig . the three components are intimately intermingled , although all three phenotypes are well recognisable as three distinct histological tumours with three different immunophenotypes ( fig . 2c a very few cases of manecs with a squamous cell carcinoma component have been previously described in the literature [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] . due to their rarity , very little is known about their histogenesis . interesting findings have been published by furlan et al . , including 5 mixed endocrine - exocrine tumours ( 2 gastric and 3 colonic ) and 1 rectal collision tumour studied using 35 polymorphic microsatellite markers . a close genetic relationship between the two distinct histologic components within mixed endocrine - exocrine tumours was found , supporting the hypothesis that a monoclonal mechanism of tumorigenesis was the most frequent genetic event in mixed exocrine - endocrine tumours . clonal divergence was observed in the only collision tumour investigated , composed of a well differentiated endocrine carcinoma associated with an adenocarcinoma , confirming the existence of double tumours growing next to each other coincidentally but showing different histogenesis and different tumorgenetic pathways . based on the findings of furlan et al . , we can postulate that our gastric manec , composed of three histologically distinct tumours but intimately mixed together , is most likely derived from a common pluripotent progenitor / stem cell . a few other authors have postulated the origin from a pluripotential precursor cell [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] . as for the histogenesis , the fine needle aspiration of one of the liver lesions had demonstrated the neuroendocrine nature of the liver metastases , lately confirmed by the avid uptake on octreoscan . kim and chae   have recently published similar findings : the nec component of their gastric manec had shown more aggressive features , invading into the serosa and the lymphatic glands , whereas the glandular carcinoma was confined to the mucosa and submucosa . reported that the clinical behaviour of composite carcinomas depends on the adenocarcinomatous component if the associated endocrine component is well differentiated and upon the neuroendocrine component if it is poorly differentiated . treatment of localized gastric necs usually involves total gastrectomy . in cases with distant metastases , ideally , we would have commenced our patient on a platinum - based chemotherapy regimen . however , in view of the patient 's poor performance status , we started him on palliative treatment with long - acting somatostatin analogues . , we reported a peculiar gastric manec with trilineage cell differentiation ( nec + adenocarcinoma + squamous cell carcinoma ) , of which only the nec component metastasised to the liver . as all manecs seem to be very aggressive from the early beginning and platinum - based chemotherapy should be the first - choice treatment in advanced disease , there are no data to support the hypothesis that the presence of a third cell clone can have some implications to the overall behaviour of those tumours .\",\n",

( a ) orthopantomogram showing the retained deciduous teeth with missing permanent successors . note also the extent of the deciduous root resorption . ( b ) anterior view of the diagnostic wax - up , ( c ) pretreatment intraoral anterior view photograph . a healthy british caucasian female was referred to me for restorative opinion from joint orthodontic / restorative hypodontia clinic at guy 's hospital as it was noticed that at the age of 18 her maxillary deciduous lateral incisors and canines were mobile . she was concerned about the loss of the deciduous mobile teeth and the effect of this will have on her appearance . she had competent lips with a high smile line in forced smiling . on examination , she had healthy mucosa and her oral hygiene was fair with mild marginal inflammation . basic periodontal examination ( bpe ) showed no periodontal pockets > 3.5  mm , no calculus / overhangs , but had bleeding after probing in the posterior areas only . the permanent teeth present in the maxillary arch were central incisors , premolars and first molar , while the mandibular arch was fully dentate until the second molar . the patient presented with an angles class i incisor relationship on a class i skeletal base with a class iii molar relationship in the buccal segments . the estimated space for the existing deciduous upper laterals and canines on the left side was 17  mm and on the right side was 15  mm . study casts were constructed and a diagnostic wax - up was performed and analyzed . all retained deciduous teeth had a moderate degree of root resorption and are due to exfoliate thus it was decided to extract all the retained deciduous teeth . additionally , the age of the patient was suitable to have implant therapy to achieve maximum alveolar bone preservation . the aim of the treatment was to improve esthetics of the maxillary labial segments . to finalize the treatment strategy a period of information gathering and careful discussion with patient and a phased treatment plan approach primary impressions were taken and study casts were duplicated and then mounted on a denar articulator using a face - bow transfer and interocclusal record taken at intercuspal contact position . diagnostic wax - up was performed at the existing vertical dimension , which enabled the achievement of esthetically reasonable morphology of teeth . options for management of missing teeth based on clinical , radiographic examinations , and diagnostic wax - up are : \\n implant - retained prostheses to replace missing maxillary teeth with single implant - retained crowns were considered the best option because it is the most conservative method of replacement . \\n \\n this was not an ideal option due to potential compromise to the remaining dentition by increasing plaque accumulation . \\n \\n fixed restorations to replace maxillary lateral incisors and canines on both sides with resin retained fixed  in addition , the first premolars would not be the ideal abutment teeth as they were rotated and to replace missing teeth with conventional fixed  extractions were done prior to implant surgery to promote primary closure at the sites of implant - fixtures placement . \\n mid crestal and vertical relieving incisions to preserve gingival papilla around the teeth were made and full thickness flaps were elevated . the patient was scheduled for stage ii surgery 3  months after implant placement . during stage ii surgery , cover screws were removed and replaced with healing abutments . the patient was reviewed 3  weeks after stage ii to proceed with the restorative phase . fixture head impressions of the maxillary implants were taken using an open tray technique for the construction of provisional restorations . at this impression making visit abutment selection was carried out using the fixture head cast and putty matrix of diagnostic wax - up . an alginate impression of the provisional restorations in situ , a face - bow transfer and interocclusal records were also taken . maxillary anterior metal - ceramic crowns were fitted , checked for fit at margins , esthetics , and occlusion . the patient was reviewed after 1  month and she was very happy with the treatment outcome and felt more confident with her smile . restoring the missing permanent teeth was considered to be a challenge with the elements of anterior segment spacing and high smile line 4 . the condition requires careful treatment planning and consideration of the options and outcomes following either space closure or prosthetic replacement . therefore , single implant - retained restorations were considered to be the most suitable option in this case rather than one implant - retained cantilever bridge as many studies showed that cantilevers increase forces on supporting implant . nevertheless , since the patient have a high smile line single implants will provide an esthetically pleasing outcome . 5 stated that the position of implants needs to be restoratively rather than surgically guided , leading to a better esthetic outcome . the only reason for midline diastema closure could be the pressure caused by the immediate denture , which was worn for 4  weeks , however , a simple hawley retainer can close small diastemas in 36  months . also before and during the provisional restoration stage care was taken not to load the residual ridge and to maintain the position of the adjacent and opposing teeth . the implants were well aligned , parallel to the natural teeth and there was adequate supporting bone around them as shown in periapical radiographs ( fig.2a ) . we were not able to find a logical explanation for the closure of the midline diastema . the midline diastema may constitute an esthetic concern in many patients who might seek treatment for it . in this case the patient did seem to be concerned about this issue and the main concern was having natural tooth morphology . the closure of the midline diastema before the provisional stage actually added a great deal to the overall esthetic outcome and the patient was happy with the appearance , even though it was not considered in the treatment because it was not one of the patient priorities . ( a ) postoperative periapical radiographs were taken to assess marginal bone levels around the implants . this case showed an excellent esthetic treatment outcome using implant - retained crowns replacing maxillary laterals and canines with unusual incidence of diastema closure after the placement of implants and the patient was very happy and felt more confident with her smile . restoring the severely hypodontic dentition with implant and fixed restorations requires meticulous planning , realistic treatment goals and a highly motivated and compliant patient 4 .\",\n",

old woman , para 1 , presented with mild pain abdomen and slight bleeding per vaginum for 5 days . other relevant history included amenorrhea of 8 weeks ' duration with a positive urine pregnancy test , following which she had vaginal bleeding for 12 days . she had one child conceived through intrauterine insemination ( iui ) and delivered by lower segment uterine section ( lscs ) 3 years back . transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography ( tvs ) examination revealed a ballooned -

up , the patient was asymptomatic with a review tvs showing organized blood clot measuring 3.3 cm  2.4 cm in the cervical canal [ figure 5 ] . six weeks after the procedure , the patient resumed her periods and the review scan showed a resolving blood clot measuring 2.6 cm  1.3 cm . review transvaginal ultrasound scan at 4 weeks showing absence of fetal parts with an organized blood clot measuring 3.3 cm  2.4 cm cp results due to implantation of a fertilized ovum in the endocervical canal below the level of internal os with a reported incidence of less than 0.1% of all pregnancies . even with advanced diagnostic modalities and reduction in current maternal mortality rates , cp remains a life - threatening condition . although predisposing factors like endometrial damage after curettage or chronic endometritis , leiomyoma , intrauterine devices , in vitro fertilization and primary embryo anomaly are implicated in the pathogenesis of cp , the rarity of the condition has prevented any retrospective studies , and the association of cp with all these factors remains weak . treatment options for cp may be divided into five categories : \\n tamponade with foley catheter : use of a foley catheter , placed gently past the external os , followed by inflation of the bulb with 30 ml saline has been used mostly after other techniques ( e.g. , curettage ) , result in hemorrhage . tamponade with packing is not very usefulreduction of blood supply : this may be undertaken by cervical cerclage , vaginal ligation of cervical arteries , uterine artery ligation , internal iliac artery ligation and angiographic embolization of the cervical , uterine or internal iliac arteries . this is usually done in preparation for surgical therapy like curettage , or along with chemotherapy , as a conservative treatment modality aimed at preserving future fertility . embolization is primarily used as a  rescue  therapy when profuse bleeding follows other conservative methods like chemotherapysurgical excision of trophoblast : curettage and hysterectomy are the classic methods for surgical excision of trophoblast tissue . therefore , it has been used in conjunction with mechanical methods like cervical artery ligation and tamponade . primary hysterectomy may still be the preferred modality of treatment in intractable hemorrhage , second trimester or third trimester diagnosis of cp and possibly to avoid emergency surgery and blood transfusion in a woman not desirous of fertility . in a review , 100% of cp beyond 12 weeks ' gestation ultimately required hysterectomyintra -

amniotic potassium chloride in addition to systemic methotrexate . second or third trimester diagnosis may warrant hysterectomy . in a hemorrhaging patient , the treatment options are tamponade with foley balloon , large vessel ligation or angiographic embolization with hysterectomy reserved for intractable bleeding . treatment with methotrexate chemotherapy of patients with either viable or nonviable cp at < 12 weeks ' gestation carries a high success rate ( > 91% ) for preservation of the uterus . although intra - amniotic instillation of potassium chloride has been advocated in the presence of cardiac activity , the procedure requires a high level of skill and familiarity and is associated with the risk of hemorrhage . therefore , in our case , we chose to manage the patient with systemic methotrexate followed by mva and cervical tamponade as this was the least invasive modality . it is important to distinguish among cp , cervical abortion and uterine scar pregnancy . in 2002 , the following guidelines were laid down for ultrasound diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy within a cesarean scar:(a ) an empty uterine cavity and cervical canal , ( b ) development of the gestational sac in the anterior portion of the lower uterine segment and ( c ) absence of a healthy myometrium between the bladder and the gestational sac . although her history included iui , which is a risk factor for cp , and we could rule out cervical abortion due to the presence of cardiac activity , it was difficult to exclude the possibility of uterine scar pregnancy because of previous lscs . the specificity of three - dimensional ( 3d ) ultrasound imaging has been reported to be better than two - dimensional ( 2d ) scans as the 3d image incorporates an additional coronal section that is not possible with 2d imaging . because we did not have a 3d scan facility , we used mri to confirm the diagnosis of cp , as tissue characterization is better with mri when compared with ultrasound , especially in doubtful cases such as this . the mri findings of cp include : ( a ) presence of a mass with heterogeneous signal intensity and ( b ) partial or complete dark rim on t2-weighted images . in conclusion , a case of cp is described where multi - modality investigations were used in the diagnosis , which aided the subsequent management , resulting in successful preservation of fertility .\",\n",

alpha . several other factors have been proposed to cause spontaneous regression , such as abstinence from alcohol , consumption of herbal medicines , high fevers , gastrointestinal bleeding , rapid tumor growth and the use of vitamin k . spontaneous resolution of hcc with distant metastasis to the lungs , chest wall , skull , peritoneum and spleen   has been reported . a case similar to ours was reported with a large right liver lobe and portal vein thrombosis , followed by subsequent tumor regression . tumor regression of different sizes has been described in the literature and outcome in most of the cases has been favorable with few recurrences . in cases it is quite possible that arterioportal shunt near the tumor may change the dynamics of blood flow to the tumor as blood supply is essential for tumor growth .   similar to transarterial chemoembolization , the tumor infarction due to disruption of the feeding artery or portal vein caused by subintimal injury , thrombus , and tumor invasion could result in tumor necrosis and regression of hcc . another explanation considered is   coagulative necrosis produced by interruption of the blood supply due to the spontaneous formation of an arterial thrombus , , . in the index case considering the acute onset of symptoms , we speculated that local ischemia due to rapid tumor growth resulted in intra tumoral bleeding and/or hemorrhagic necrosis . such an explanation was proposed for some cases in the literature which showed histologically complete necrosis in the resected mass .   we conclude that complete spontaneous resolution of hcc , though rare ,   provides an avenue for further research . the accumulation and careful analysis of clinical data obtained from patients with spontaneous resolution of hcc will contribute to the understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon , and potentially to the future development of new treatment strategies for hcc .',\n",

regional extension of the adjacent tumour like breast cancer ( 11 ) . sternal spread may occur directly from the adjacent neoplasm or from the parasternal lymph node involvement ( 11 ) . bone involvement in lung cancer occurs either by direct extension into adjacent bones like ribs , sternum , thoracic vertebrae , or by hematogenous spread as in humerus , or lumber vertebra ( 12 ) . pathologically , the patients with localized rib involvement constitute t3 on the basis of seventh edition tnm staging system for lung cancer ; so staged as stage iib or iiia ( 13 ) . but in both the situations , surgery is a possible option for loco -

( a , b ) : coronal and sagittal ct scan images showing a large lobulated mass occupying the gastro - splenic and gastro - pancreatic regions and extending inferiorly . tortuous portal vein , smv and splenic vein are noted combination chemotherapy was initiated as per the institutional protocol for pnet comprising of a six drug regimen of vincristine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , actinomycin d , ifosfamide and etoposide . after the initial nine weeks of induction therapy , ct scan showed a persistent mass with no change in the extent of the disease . on exploratory laparotomy , the mass was densely adherent to the greater curvature of the stomach and the transverse colon was draped over the anterior surface . after extensive and meticulous dissection , the mass was found to be arising from the body and tail of pancreas . distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and transverse colon resection was performed and the bowel continuity restored with an end - to - end colocolic anastomosis . thorough search of the peritoneal cavity revealed a few peritoneal nodules on the posterior wall of the pylorus , porta , and peripancreatic region which were also resected . grossly , the mass measured 24  17  9 cm and the cut surface largely consisted of areas of necrosis with lobulated fleshy , white areas [ figure 2 ] . microscopically , the tumor was composed of small round malignant cells with focal fibrous septa and necrosis . the tumor cells were also seen invading the intestine and the splenic hilum [ figure 3 ] . immunostaining with cd99 was equivocal and the cells showed cytoplasmic , but not nuclear , expression of wt1 . reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rtpcr ) using rna extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded revealed ews - wt1 gene fusion chimeric transcript , confirming a diagnosis of dsrct . pancreatic stump is also seen ( held with forceps ) a ) a malignant small round cell tumor infiltrating the b ) pancreas and c ) the wall of the colon . e ) ews - wt1 fusion transcript as demonstrated by rt - pcr the patient received abdominopelvic radiotherapy along with concurrent chemotherapy following which maintenance chemotherapy was initiated . the patient developed intractable upper gastrointestinal bleeding manifested by hematemesis and melena , which significantly curtailed maintenance chemotherapy . the exact cause of the bleeding could not be ascertained but was attributed to the abdominopelvic radiotherapy . the patient , however , responded to prolonged conservative management and is now on regular follow - up with serial ultrasound examination . at 14 months from the last chemotherapy , dsrct is a rare and highly aggressive neoplasm described as a separate entity by gerald and rosai in 1989 . the exclusivity of dsrct is due to its distinct clinical , histologic and immunophenotypic features and rarity , which makes it an often misdiagnosed neoplasm of children and adolescents . it has a propensity for serosal surfaces , especially in the peritoneal cavity , characterized by the presence of large abdominal masses without any obvious organ base and widespread peritoneal involvement . however , the present case is unique , wherein the abdominal disease though extensive originated from the pancreas and infiltrated the colon , splenic hilum and greater curvature of the stomach ; although , on critical review of the ct scan in retrospect , pancreatic origin could be conjectured it became apparent only on exploratory laparotomy [ figure 4 ] . even though the extent of disease necessitated a substantial resection , a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic origin would have helped in careful planning for the surgery considering the complex nature of surgery of the pancreas . a systematic review of indexed , english medical literature revealed only three previously published reports of dsrct arising in the pancreas.[35 ] axial image shows the probable attachment of the mass to the pancreatic body and tail the rarity of this tumor and the similarities it shares with other small round cell tumors makes the diagnosis challenging . it has a polyphenotypic immunostaining profile ; however , the chromosomal abnormality is very specific for dsrct . in the present case , the diagnosis of dsrct was confirmed with a positive ews - wt1 fusion transcript on rt - pcr . an accurate diagnosis is essential in planning the therapy , anticipation of distinct tendencies ( serosal spread ) and importantly prognostication of the disease . evidently this was not possible in the present case due to limitations in the initial diagnosis . multidisciplinary treatment including intensive multiagent chemotherapy , aggressive debulking surgery ( > 90% resection ) , adjuvant abdominopelvic radiation with or without myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue have been reported to improve survival in dsrct , although cure remains elusive in widespread disease . more effective therapeutic options including targeted therapies focusing on cellular regulatory mechanisms and pathways for this tumor need to be explored to improve outcome and reduce treatment - related toxicity . in the present case , although contemporary curative treatment had been offered , but the treatment toxicity was a limiting factor in dispensing comprehensive therapy , thereby justifying the need for alternate less toxic treatment modalities . in conclusion , although there were no misadventures in our case despite the lacunae , we reiterate the significance and advocate endeavor for achieving diagnosis and ascertaining the primary site of tumor origin .',\n",

however , there were no cardiac anomalies . in view of the absence of features such as retinal degeneration and renal anomalies , which are most common in bbs during neonatal period , it was not considered ; also , obesity and mental retardation are usually seen in infancy . secretory type : it is secondary to accumulated mucus secreted by the uterine and cervical glands stimulated in utero by maternal estrogen.urinary type : it is secondary to the accumulation of urine in the presence of a vaginal obstruction . secretory type : it is secondary to accumulated mucus secreted by the uterine and cervical glands stimulated in utero by maternal estrogen . urinary type : it is secondary to the accumulation of urine in the presence of a vaginal obstruction . the incidence of congenital hmc varies from 0.0014 to 0.1% in full - term newborn females with almost 90% having polydactyly . neonatal hmc frequently results from anatomical malformations of the genital tract such as vaginal atresia , transverse vaginal septum , and imperforate hymen ; which lead to blockage of drainage of the secretions , which in turn leads to hmc.5,6 neonatal hmc is an obstructive mullerian duct anomaly . the type of mullerian duct anomaly is based on embryologic steps of lateral and vertical fusion during fetal life . during the process of lateral fusion , the mullerian ducts develop at 56 weeks of gestational age from the coelomic epithelium simultaneously with wolffian ( mesonephric ) ducts , which is placed lateral to coelomic epithelium . they usually fuse at about 79 weeks of gestational age in the midline to form the uterovaginal canal . during the process of vertical fusion at 8 weeks of gestation , the uterovaginal canal fuses with urogenital sinus at the mullerian tubercle ; the urogenital sinus results from separation of the cloaca into the urogenital sinus and rectum . hence , the vagina is formed by both the mullerian ducts ( upper two thirds ) and the urogenital sinus ( lower one third ) . embryology reveals the different types of hmcs observed ; secretory type occurs secondary to defect in upper two thirds and urinary type occurs as a result of defect in lower one third.7 congenital hmc accounts for around 15% of intra - abdominal cystic masses in female infants . it has also been associated with urinary or intestinal tract abnormalities.8 the clinical features are varied and usually seen as an abdominal mass that may compress the adjacent organs like bladder , ureters , bowel , or pelvic veins , resulting in urinary retention , constipation , ascites , lower limb edema , or rarely life threatening conditions.9 postnatally , it can be suspected when lower abdominal swelling persists in spite of urinary catheterization.10 antenatally , ultrasonography remains the most widely used diagnostic imaging technique for identification of hmc and it is suspected when the scan shows the presence of large cystic abdominopelvic mass with a fluid - debris level.11 mri can also be used as a useful complementary tool for assessing fetal urogenital anomalies when ultrasonography is inconclusive.12,13 postnatally diagnosis of hmc is confirmed by ultrasound abdomen echography and ct scan.14 the definitive treatment involves drainage of the accumulated fluid in the uterine cavity and establishing communication between the vaginal epithelium and the vulva . in the cases of hmc treatment varies from the simple x - shaped hymenotomy for the isolated imperforate hymen to major surgery for complex urogenital abnormalities . abdominoperineal approach is usually preferred in cases of high vaginal atresia.15,16 the mks is induced by variations in the mkks gene mapped onto chromosome 20p12 between d20s162 and d20s894 markers . the diagnosis of mks in males is based on genital malformations ( most commonly hypospadias , cryptorchidism , and chordae ) , postaxial polydactyly , and congenital heart disease ( chd ) . chd includes atrioventricular canal , ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) , or hypoplastic left heart , which is present in nearly 1020% of cases . long - term cognition is normal.11 other associated findings include gastrointestinal abnormalities ( 28% ) : imperforate anus , rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistula , hirschsprung s disease and malrotation , and abnormalities ( 5% ) of the eyes.17 hmc , polydactyly , and cardiac defects as well occur in bbs . the characteristic combination of findings in bbs are rod cone dystrophy in eyes ( 93100% ) , polydactyly ( 5869% ) , obesity ( 7288% ) , learning disabilities ( 4162% ) , hypogonadism in males ( 8590% ) , and renal anomalies ( 25100% ) . the secondary features include speech disorders or delays ; eye abnormalities , such as complex female genitourinary malformations , strabismus , cataract , and astigmatism ; brachydactyly or syndactyly ; developmental delays ; ataxia ; diabetes mellitus ; craniofacial dysmorphism ; nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ; hepatic fibrosis ; and congenital heart disease . the bbs phenotype is seen in individuals with mutations in 14 different genes.18 other differential diagnosis includes evc syndrome that is characterized by polydactyly , acromelic growth retardation , ectodermal dysplasia with dystrophy of nails , and cardiac anomalies ( most common atrial septal defect ) , and pallister  hall syndrome that is characterized by facial anomalies , postaxial polydactyly , imperforate anus , and cns anomalies like diencephalic hamartoblastoma.19,20 the limitation of our case report is that we were not able to perform the gene analysis of the infant to get the exact diagnosis of the syndrome . the suspicion of bbs or mks is made based on the clinical features ; and evaluation of an infant with mks or bbs includes ultrasound study of pelvis , kidney and urinary bladder , skeletal radiographs , ekg , and echocardiogram . the bbs is confirmed by genetic analysis of bbs genes ( bbs1bbs11 genes ) and the mks is confirmed by genetic analysis of mkks genes on chromosome 20p12 between d20s162 and d20s894 markers.21 the evc syndrome is confirmed by genetic analysis of evc1 and evc2 genes.19 pallister  hall syndrome is confirmed by genetic analysis of gli3 gene.20 hmc is a rare condition in the neonate and should be suspected when a prenatal ultrasound identifies a midline abdomino - pelvic mass . prenatal diagnosis and early newborn imaging lead to early detection and treatment of these cases .',\n",

growth in adjacent organs . the most frequent complaint of patients with a rectal gist is change in bowel movement due to tumor size and/or gastrointestinal bleeding , when the overlying mucosa is ulcerated . surgical removal remains the only curative treatment for patients with gist , but tumors with metastasis are considered to be inoperable . chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy showed to have disappointing results [ 1 , 6 ] and no remarkable response may be expected from neither of these two . recently , a new drug , imatinib ( sti-571 ) , was launched , and many promising results already have been reported . imatinib is a signal transduction inhibitor , inhibiting amongst others the signalling of the kit - tyrosine kinase , which switches the balance towards reduced cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis . good results have been reported in the treatment of locally irresectable or metastatic gist , in terms of partial response or stable disease [ 4 , 7 , 8 ] . have reported some promising results , but the effect of imatinib as adjuvant and neo -

term follow - up must be awaited to clarify the behavior of the tumor and metastases on long - term treatment with this new tyrosine kinase inhibitor . found that to achieve response induction , a daily dose of 400 mg is sufficient to reach this goal , but a dose of 400 mg twice a day achieves significantly longer progression - free survival , especially in widespread metastatic disease . imatinib as a neo - adjuvant to downsize giant gist of the rectum before surgery might help reach resectability of the tumor . at the time the first patient , case 1 , attended our hospital , the drug was not available for clinical use in the netherlands . at present , first a treatment with imatinib would be initiated to downsize the tumor in order to improve the likelihood of a radical resection and reduce perioperative morbidity . surgery remains the only chance of complete removal of the gist . as an adjuvant , imatinib is promising in reaching stable disease and prolong symptom - free interval after surgery , especially in metastatic disease or when local recurrence occurs . at the time of diagnosis approximately 1050% of patients have overtly metastatic disease . for large irresectable symptomatic gastrointestinal tumors of the rectum with metastatic spread , single therapy with this drug might also be an option to decrease symptoms and even no surgery will be necessary in some cases . this is shown in case 2 , where stable disease was reached and symptoms disappeared after starting imatinib . for now , long - term follow - up and prospective trials are needed to explore the possibilities of this novel drug which is a breakthrough in the treatment of a potentially lethal disease .\",\n",

old woman presented with a 3-month history of headache , vomiting and weight loss followed by clumsiness of her right arm and leg . one week before admission , uncontrollable movements of the neck started , which interfered with her activities . general physical examination disclosed oral candidiasis and a herpes zoster scar on the left t8-t10 dermatomes . stereotypic slow movements of the head with rotation to the right side were noted , causing an abnormal posture , accompanied by right deviation of gaze and mouth opening like a yawn ( online suppl . this movement disorder was preceded by a premonitory urge , with discomfort on the neck , which was relieved by cervical rotation . if asked to volitionally suppress this movement , it could be done for few seconds but would become worse later on . her brain ct and mri showed bilateral basal ganglion granuloma using peripheral contrast enhancement and edema , which were suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis ( fig . electroencephalogram recordings were normal , even during her abnormal movements . a routine blood sample revealed only positive anti - hcv serology . due to the clinical and complementary data , she was diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis associated with hiv and hepatitis c virus infection . she was treated with sulfadiazine , pyrimethamine and folinic acid for 6 weeks , with partial clinical and radiological improvement . in spite of the treatment , the involuntary movement persisted . it was interpreted as a complex dystonic tic involving the cervical , extraocular and oral musculature , occurring secondary to toxoplasmosis lesions involving the basal ganglia . treatment was started with risperidone 1 mg / day , with full remission of her tic symptoms within 7 days . the aim of this report was to present a tic disorder , a rare occurrence in patients with hiv , highlighting that abnormal movements can give an important clue to hiv diagnosis or its complications , if recognized . differential diagnosis is not easy , demanding subsidiary examinations and careful evaluation of the movement disorder phenomenology . dystonia has been rarely reported in patients with aids [ 7 , 8 ] , although it has been hypothesized that there are dopamine - related changes in patients with hiv infection that could increase the susceptibility to develop dystonia . factor et al .   reported 4 patients with dystonia and aids due to different causes , e.g. multifocal leukoencephalopathy , toxoplasmosis and drugs . the movement disorder of our patient resembled cervical dystonia , but the simultaneous oral and ocular movements , premonitory feelings and partial voluntary suppression of movements were against this hypothesis . in our case , stereotypes were also considered for differential diagnosis especially due to the partial voluntary suppression of symptoms that the patient achieved , but there was a premonitory urge suggestive of tic disorder . most cases of stereotypes are simple , with rocking , hugging , self - touching , patting , grunting , foot tapping , leg swinging and hair pulling . stereotypes are more common in children , mainly in the context of autism or other hereditary diseases , or even secondary to some drugs . the presence of this movement disorder has not been reported in patients with brain infections . paroxysmal dyskinesias can be dystonic or choreic , and occur suddenly and transiently in the absence of an altered level of consciousness , with complete recovery between attacks . it can be associated with neuronal injury and loss in the basal ganglia , but the exact mechanism has not been determined yet . in a series of 6 seropositive patients with paroxysmal dyskinesia it was not considered in this case , since the movement disorder was continuous , lacking a remission period . tics are unvoluntary movements induced either by an inner sensory stimulus , like needing to stretch a body part , or by an unwanted feeling or compulsion . they are characterized by sudden , often repetitive , movements , gestures and utterances that mimic fragments of normal behavior and are typically present in tourette 's syndrome . tics may be classified as simple or complex , and as tonic , clonic or dystonic , according to their velocity and muscle contraction , isometric and isotonic . studies concerning the pathogenesis of tics have been mainly directed to tourette 's syndrome , and most of them point to an abnormality in frontal - subcortical pathways , which possibly causes a decreased inhibition of the motor cortex , but the exact mechanisms are still unknown . preliminary functional mri studies have shown significant changes in signal intensity in basal ganglia and thalamus , as well as in connected cortical regions . a hypothesis attributing tic pathophysiology to neurotransmitters pointed to a distinct level of dopaminergic changes , such as dopamine hyperinnervation , presynaptic dopa decarboxylase abnormality or even a postsynaptic involvement of the dopamine receptor . on the other hand , those dopamine abnormalities would not be sufficient to explain tourette 's syndrome , and many authors also ascribe serotonin a possible role . a summary of the results of those theories and studies converge to the fact that tics are related to cortical - striato - thalamo - cortical circuits , with decreased inhibition of the cortex . previously , cases of tics or tourettism have been reported in the context of focal lesions , e.g. tumors involving basal ganglia and also multiple sclerosis lesions [ 15 , 16 ] . the diagnosis reached after excluding the aforementioned differential diagnoses and considering the topography of lesions was dystonic tic . we believe that toxoplasma granulomas and perilesional edema involving basal ganglia can explain this movement disorder . tic disorder was previously reported in the context of hiv infection in a patient with encephalopathy and transient motor and vocal tics . in conclusion , treating physicians should be aware that abnormal movements  even tics  may be a potential source for misdiagnosis in hiv patients and that the correct identification of the movement disorder supplemented with subsidiary examinations ruling out other differential diagnoses helps to establish the diagnosis and improve therapeutic outcomes .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'a 33-year - old woman with a five - year history of essential thrombocythemia , was admitted to our hospital after the recent detection of a palpable mass in the left flank . laboratory findings at the time of admission included a hemoglobin level of 14.7 g / dl , a platelet count of 7310/l , and leukocyte count of 24,010/l . hepatitis serologic markers such as hbs ag , hcv ab , and hav ab were all negative . a non - contrast ct scan showed a 2-cm sized , fairly well - defined , and homogeneously low attenuated mass in segment vi of the liver ( data not shown ) . on contrast - enhanced , portal venous phase ct , most of the lesion showed intense enhancement ( fig . no other focal lesions were identified in the spleen , kidneys or paravertebral region . on mri , the lesion showed homogeneously low and high signal intensity on t1- ( repetition time [ tr]/echo time [ te ] = 140 msec/2.4 msec , flip angle [ fa ] = 70 ) ( fig . 1b ) and fat - saturated t2-weighted fast spin echo images ( tr / te = 12,857.1/100.7 ) ( fig . 1c ) , respectively . there was no signal change between the in- and opposed - phase t1-weighted images . after the administration of a dose of 0.5 mmol / kg gadolinium ( gd ) ( gd - bopta , multihance , bracco imaging , milan , italy ) , the lesion showed homogeneous and intense enhancement on the arterial phase ( 20 seconds after contrast agent administration ) and enhanced persistently until five minutes after gd administration ( fig . there was no signal drop in the mass on t2-weighted images ( tr / te = 130.0/9.7 , fa = 30 ) obtained 10 minutes following the administration of 1.4 ml of an spio agent ( shu 555a , resovist , schering ag , germany ) ( fig . considering that the patient had taken an anabolic steroid for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia and the mass had manifested as a well - defined hypervascular lesion , the most probable radiological diagnosis at this point was a hepatocellular adenoma . differential possibilities also included other hypervascular hepatic neoplasms such as a focal nodular hyperplasia ( fnh ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , angiomyolipoma , and a solitary hypervascular metastasis . although the patient did not have any predisposing factors for hcc , a hepatic tumorectomy was performed , as the possibility of a hepatic malignancy could not be excluded . an splenectomy was also scheduled for the symptomatic splenomegaly regardless of the nature of the hepatic lesion . grossly , a homogeneously reddish mass without necrosis or hemorrhage was seen in the liver . microscopically , megakaryocytes and pleomorphic groups of erythroids and myeloid precursors , which are known as the three hematological precursor cell - lines , were seen insinuating into the hepatocyte cords ( fig . even though there were some histiocytic cells that are usually considered as precursors of res cells , no kupffer cells were found in the lesion by hematoxylin and eosin staining . to investigate the pathological background for the lack of spio uptake by the lesion , immunohistochemical staining using the cd68 marker was performed . immunohistochemical staining revealed that the cells in emh were positive for cd68 , as in the normal hepatic parenchyma . however , the degree of staining in the lesion ( weak positive ) was much weaker than that in the normal liver ( positive ) ( fig contrary to previous reports in which focal intrahepatic emh appeared as a heterogeneously enhancing or non - enhancing mass on contrast - enhanced ct ( 1 - 9 ) , this case exhibited homogeneous and persistent enhancement on dynamic gd - enhanced mri . we are unable to explain exactly why there was such a discrepancy in the enhancement pattern of the two imaging modalities . however , earlier studies comparing the mri and ct hepatic imaging of focal liver lesions showed that the use of mri has several advantages over the use of ct , including greater sensitivity to intravascular contrast agents ( gd - chelate for mri and iodinated agents for ct ) ( 11 ) . another theoretical advantage of the use of mri over the use of ct in terms of contrast enhancement is that the contrast material is delivered in a smaller volume over a shorter period in mr examinations , resulting in a tighter bolus . considering the greater sensitivity to the contrast agent and tighter bolus injection of the contrast agent on mri than on ct , the enhancement for a small hepatic lesion might have been more adequately identified on mri . considering the rarity of the emh disease entity , it may not be included in the initial differential lists of hypervascular hepatic lesions . however , given that almost all patients diagnosed with focal intrahepatic emh had some underlying hematological disorder as a predisposing factor ( 9 ) , we believe that it merits consideration in the appropriate clinical setting . since the early 1980s , the use of spio has been applied to various hepatic and splenic diseases , and many findings for enhanced lesion characterization have been reported ( 12 , 13 ) . due to the res tissue specificity of spio , it profoundly decreases the signal intensity of the tissues containing res cells , such as kupffer cells , but not that of a lesion without res cells , thereby enabling tissue characterization . there are two commercially available intravenous spio agents : ami-25 ( feridex ) and shu 555a ( resovist ) . unlike ami-25 , shu 555a may be phagocytosed by res cells , i.e. , macrophages , within the bone marrow as well as by res cells in the liver and spleen due to its smaller size ( 14 , 15 ) . theoretically , as emh can possess all marrow cells , including reticuloendothelial system ( res ) precursor cells , it is expected that intrahepatic emh would show a signal drop on a t2-weighted gradient echo sequence following spio administration . indeed , in the pathological specimen of the present case , there were many histiocytic cells that were considered as precursors of res cells as seen by h and e staining . however , contrary to our expectation , the case did not show any signal drop on post - spio t2-weighted mr images . there are several possible explanations for this result . even though all types of res cells , including bone marrow cells may uptake shu 555a particles the strength of the affinity of this contrast agent for each cell is different . shu 555a has the strongest affinity to kupffer cells , followed by res cells in the spleen and macrophages in the bone marrow ( 14 , 15 ) . therefore , the signal drop induced by spio uptake should follow this tendency , resulting in a weak or even no signal drop of the intrahepatic emh . as the ultra - small spio ( uspio ) agents can easily cross the capillary wall due to their small size and prolongation of the blood half - life , it is well known that uspio can be taken up by the res cells of the bone marrow and lymph nodes ( 16 ) . if we had used the uspio agent as a t2- or t2-contrast agent , we might have observed the signal drop within the emh in our case . a second possible explanation for the absence of a signal drop in the lesion on post - spio t2-weighted mr images may be the short delay time following spio administration . according to previous reports ( 15 ) , spio uptake in the bone marrow and subsequent decreased relaxation time of the tissue usually occur within one to 24 hours , or two hours after spio injection . however , in the case of liver mr imaging using shu 555a , a 10 minute delay is optimal in obtaining a signal drop of the liver and spleen . therefore , such a short delay time might not be sufficient to induce a signal drop in the histiocyte - precursor cells of the emh . as this case study is the first to report the spio - enhanced mri findings of emh that did not show an apparent signal drop after spio administration however , there have been comparable reports regarding the diagnosis of emh using tc-99 m sulfur - colloid scintigraphy ( 6 , 17 , 18 ) . in addition , of the three reported cases of emh , one case that was reported by abbitt et al . ( 18 ) showed positive tc-99 m sulfur - colloid scintigraphy whereas the other two cases were negative . considering the similarity of the enhancement mechanism between tc-99 m sulfur - colloid scintigraphy and spio - enhanced mri , the spio - mri appearance of emh is also expected to be variable . therefore , further studies using a large number of cases are warranted to investigate the spio - enhanced mri findings of emh in the liver . in the present case , the correct diagnosis was not originally considered as a focal intrahepatic emh presenting as a homogeneously and persistently enhancing mass has never been described or included in the differential diagnosis of hypervascular liver lesions . the differential diagnosis for hypervascular liver lesions in a non - cirrhotic liver includes benign tumors such as adenomas , fnh , and occasionally angiomyolipomas . this observation provides further support for the inclusion of an intrahepatic emh in the differential diagnosis of hypervascular and tumor - like masses without spio ( shu 555a ) uptake in patients with hematological diseases .',\n",

thus , adequate predilation with a balloon catheter may help prevent stent loss . also , when resistance is encountered during undeployed stent withdrawal , removal of the entire system including the stent , wire , and guide catheter may help prevent stent dislodgement . nowadays , with the development of intracoronary procedures , stent loss and dislodgement occur rarely . nevertheless , every catheterization laboratory should be equipped with a set of instruments for intravascular foreign body retrieval and interventional cardiologists should be familiar with these retrieval methods and techniques .',\n",

however , the differences are as follow . we thought this method would reconstruct the gluteus medius and minimus simultaneously and may stabilize the femoral head in the acetabulum more effectively due to its closer location from the joint . the second one is posterior capsule enforcement with posterior fiber of gluteus maximus . theoretically , it would be better than no soft tissue envelop in terms of preventing dislocation . but we ca n't make sure the effectiveness in the artificial joint . because many hip surgeons experiences that dislocation does n't happen in the artificial joint without posterior capsule . the correct position of the implant , reconstruction of the deficient abductor and patient education are the cornerstone to prevent the dislocation . however , it 's impossible to transfer this muscle because combined deficiency with gluteus medius due to superior gluteal neuropathy . we think current technique is one of the useful treatment methods to gain joint stability and abductor function in the abductor deficient hip joint .\",\n",

up of patient is required post - operatively . traumatic dislocation of hip in children is a rare entity accounting for less than 5% of pediatric dislocation and neglected post traumatic dislocation of hip is much more rare . of them the character of injury tends to vary , in that children under the age of 6 years suffer isolated hip dislocation due to low energy trauma , whereas older children require high energy trauma . most of the dislocation of hip in children can be reduced easily but delay in reduction of hip of more than 6 hours are associated with poor outcome because as the time interval between dislocation and reduction increases , incidence of complications like avascular necrosis of femoral head , redislocation , heterotopic ossification and chondrolysis . there have been very few cases of post - traumatic neglected posterior dislocation of hip   ( table 1 ) . heterotopic ossification in neglected post traumatic posterior dislocation in children is known but devastating and a very rare occurrence . we report one such case literature review of case series of post traumatic neglected hip dislocation in children . a 5 year female child resident of a village in uttar pradesh presented with history of fall from height in school after which she was unable to walk due to pain in left hip region . the patient was taken to local quack where she was treated with massaging and wooden splintage around left hip region for 2 - 3 weeks and was kept on bed rest . after removal of splintage patient was unable to bear weight on left lower limb due to pain . the patient was brought 4 months post trauma to our hospital for treatment . on clinical examination patient had findings suggestive of posterior dislocation of femoral head . range of motion at left hip was painful and restricted , associated with muscle spasms so under normal condition telescopy could nt be illustrated but it was found to be positive under anaesthesia . x - ray showed posterior dislocation of hip with heterotopic ossification postero - supero - laterally forming pseudo - acetabulum ( fig . 1 & 2 ) . all lab investigations were within normal limits including serum calcium , phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase . pre - operative antero - posterior radiograph of patient showing posterior dislocation of hip with heterotopic ossification postero - supero - laterally forming pseudo - acetabulum . cresent shaped heterotopic ossification is seen forming pseudoacetabulum ct scan of the patient showing showing posterior dislocation of hip with heterotopic ossification postero -

arm guidance head was fixed to acetabulum with a single k wire of 1.6 mm ( 0.062 inch ) as a precautionary measure in view of non compliance of patient and parents ( figure 5 ) . post operatively child was kept in hip spica for 8 weeks and course of indomethacin was given for 3 weeks . 5 ) . on examination after removal k wire and spica cast under c- arm congruency of reduction and stability of femoral head was checked through out the range of motion of hip . the patient was kept on nil weight bearing for 1 month , followed by partial weight bearing for 3 weeks and then full weight bearing . histopathology report of excised mass forming pseudo - acetabulum revealed as mature bone suggestive of heterotopic ossification . currently 18 months post surgery patient is able to walk full weight bearing with full range of motion of left hip and no limb length discrepancy ( fig . the patient is also able to squat and run with no x - ray or clinical evidence of avascular necrosis of femoral head ( fig . patients entire heterotopic mass was removed and throughout our follow - up 18 months there were no evidence of reappearence of the same . a- immediate post - operative antero - posterior view of patient showing reduced hip dislocation with a transfixing k - wire through hip joint . b- 6 weeks post surgery with k wire removed ap lateral radiograph of patient after 18 months showing reduced hip joint with no other abnormality . post traumatic hip dislocation in children is a rare entity and its neglected type is much rarer as stated by kumar et al . we have made a table of all the case series of  neglected post - traumatic dislocation of hip in children  searched from pubmed and google from the available literature ( table 1 ) . this table clearly shows that the results vary and are not predictable and such occurrences are indeed rare . post- traumatic dislocation of hip are to be treated as early as possible and best results are obtained by doing closed reduction within 6 hours of trauma . in neglected post traumatic dislocation of hip in children no fixed time interval can be framed within which surgery is advised . our case further adds to case series of banskota et al   confirming that good prognosis in such neglected cases in children can be achieved by open reduction .. heterotopic ossification around hip in children without any associated acetabular or proximal femur fracture in post- traumatic neglected dislocation of hip is very rare . its common sites around hip are anterior capsule , proximal femur , behind belly of illiopsoas and posterior capsule . preoperative extent of heterotopic ossification has previously been suggested as being the main risk factor for recurrence after excision . heterotopic ossification is more common in patients of all ages with head injury and spinal cord trauma as they are often associated with bone fracture , sepsis , prolonged immobilization , neurovegetative disorders , etc . it is much common post surgery by anterior approach in all age group and post arthroplasty by any approach in adults . early surgical intervention minimises the development of intra - articular pathology , osteoporosis and the resultant complications without increasing the risk of recurrence of heterotopic ossification . in study by mehlmann et al , 3 children out of 42 had developed heterotopic ossification and required excision . very few cases reporting such heterotopic ossification forming pseudo - acetabulum have been mentioned in literature   and we could find none associated with neglected post - traumatic dislocation . according to odak et al   such pattern of heterotopic ossification suggests chronic instability or dislocation of hip and it may be symptomatic or asymptomatic as patient might walk with limp even in presence of dislocation . our study showed that though heterotopic ossification was booker iv type , post excision it did not recur and yielded good functional results at end of follow - up . since this unusual form of heterotopic ossification have been encountered in few cases and has no terminology to denote it , we would like to name it as  pseudo - heterotopic acetabulum phenomenon ( phap )  . clinical photos of patient demonstrating patient standing , squatting comfortable with free flexion , abduction and adduction at hip joint . neglected post traumatic hip dislocation in children do not respond well to conservative line of treatment but good results are evident with appropriate surgical treatment even with posterior approach with concentric reduction of femoral head with no evidence of avascular necrosis or instability as seen in table 1 . in our case too a longer follow up will be needed to see evidence of these complications but early good results are encouraging pseudoacetabulum formation due to heterotopic ossification is a rare occurance in neglected hip dislocation in children . heterotophic ossification in shape of a pseudoacetabulum in cases of neglected hip dislocations are not reported . open reduction with excision of these  psuedo - heterotopic acetabulum phenomenon  can give good results even in these neglected cases .',\n",

although the incidence of ocular hyperemia was similar for both forms of tafluprost , it was less severe with preservative - free tafluprost.7 prostaglandin analogs have been shown to cause cme after cataract surgery . miyake et al reported that the preservatives in prostaglandin eye drops have a greater influence on the development of cme than the base compound.8 there are many reports of cme associated with latanoprost,919 which contains a relatively high bak concentration ( 0.02% ) , but there are few reports of cme associated with bak - free travoprost . bak - free tafluprost became available in western countries in 2012 ; the japanese product contains a very low concentration of bak ( 0.001% ) . to our knowledge , this is the first report of cme associated with tafluprost . risk factors for cme due to prostaglandin eye drops include a history of glaucoma surgeries , aphakia , complicated cataract surgery , scleral buckling , and vitrectomy , as well as a history of uveitis and other retinal diseases . it is rare for patients without risk factors to develop cme.915 wand et al12 reported that two of 38 high - risk cases ( 5.3% ) developed clinical cme . fukuichi et al16 found no cases of clinical cme among 68 patients without any of the reported risk factors . in cases without known risk factors , cme can appear within 23 months after surgery,17,18 while in high - risk cases , cme can develop several years after surgery.9,1113,15,20 in the former , cme may develop immediately after surgery because of temporary damage to the blood  aqueous barrier , while in cases with known risk factors , the damage to the blood aqueous barrier is protracted , resulting in a continuation of conditions that can lead to cme in the long term . in the case reported here , anterior vitreous cutting and the iol suture surgery were performed for crystalline lens dislocation ; thus , cme accompanied with srd occurred 9 months after surgery . as leakage from retinal capillaries increases , traction on the inner and outer segments of the fovea produces a small , pointed retinal detachment with a small base . when the barrier function of external limiting membrane breaks down , the serous rd enlarges and changes into a dome - shaped retinal detachment with a large base.21 tsujikawa et al reported that the outer retinal discontinuity on the external surface of the retina does not necessarily lead to poor vision.21 however , even after complete resolution of the macular edema and srd , diffuse disorganization of the outer photoreceptor layer beneath the fovea often results in poor visual acuity . in addition , a dome - shaped retinal detachment sometimes accompanies a focal defect of the outer segment of the photoreceptors above srd.21 several treatment options are available for prostaglandin - induced cme , including non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , steroids , dorzolamide hydrochloride eye drops , and oral acetazolamide ; however , in many cases , recovery can take a month or more.1113,17,19,22 we previously reported two cases in which travoprost- and latanoprost - induced cme was successfully treated in a few days with subtenon injection of triamcinolone.23 subtenon triamcinolone injection is considered to be effective and is the standard treatment for cme due to diabetic retinopathy , retinal vein occlusion , uveitis , and other conditions . therefore , in this case , we employed subtenon triamcinolone injection immediately after diagnosis , anticipating a quick recovery from cme and a subsequently minimized irreversible disruption in the sensory retina . we reported two cases in which cme did not recur for more than 3 years after resumption of prostaglandin eye drops.23 the first case was cme associated with travoprost following uneventful cataract surgery . the second case was cme associated with latanoprost after anterior vitreous cutting and iol suture . wand and gaudio20 reported two cases in which cme treated with nsaids did not recur after unoprostone and bimatoprost treatments were resumed . furthermore , wand et al reported one case in which cme did not recur after latanoprost treatment was resumed.12 callanan et al11 reported one case in which cme that was not treated with nsaids recurred after resuming treatment with latanoprost . prostaglandin has no systemic side effects and is currently the most effective drug in the form of eye drops . beta - blockers were not chosen as treatment in this case because of the patient s history of bronchitis , nor brimonidine , which was not commercially available until may 2012 in japan . thus , tafluprost use was resumed postoperatively , considering that the patient had been well - controlled and without tafluprost side effects before surgery . although we believe the risk of cme would be reduced by using tafluprost along with nsaids , the patient was informed of the necessity of careful observation . when possible , the use of prostaglandin eye drops can be resumed after a certain period of time after recovery , under careful observation . in certain cases , the concomitant use of nsaids and prostaglandin eye drops can be greatly beneficial to patients . srd was considered to be a symptom of treatment - resistant cme , which can lead to poor visual acuity after recovery . in such cases , subtenon triamcinolone injection should be considered at an early stage .',\n",

old woman . radiological , intraoperative , and histopathological findings of the tumor are discussed . to our knowledge , this case of intracranial gliofibroma is in the oldest patient ever reported . a previously healthy 58-old - year woman was referred to our hospital because of abnormal findings on computed tomography ( ct ) , which was incidentally taken for evaluation after minor head trauma . she had some minor hearing disturbance of the right ear a few years previously , but hearing was serviceable . in addition , there were no abnormal symptoms or signs , such as facial motor or sensory deficits , diplopia , seizure , or motor or sensory deficits of extremities . ct showed an iso - attenuated mass with a lobulating contour on the right medial temporal area . the lesion was destroying the petrous portion of the temporal bone with peripheral calcification density involving the right cavernous sinus and posterior fossa from the pons to the midbrain ( fig . magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging revealed that the tumor had iso - signal intensity on t1-weighted imaging ( t1wi ) , heterogeneous and relatively low density on t2-weighted imaging ( t2wi ) ( fig . the lesion caused chronic otitis media by blocking the right eustachian tube , which might have caused a hearing disturbance . on angiography , there was minimal tumor staining from a dural branch of the petrous internal carotid artery . after considering all imaging findings , our preoperative radiological diagnosis was considered to be a meningioma . immediately after surgery , she presented right peripheral - type facial palsy grade iv according to the house - brackmann grading system and mild hypesthesia along the dermatome of the trigeminal nerve maxillary branch . hematoxylin and eosin stain , the masson trichrome stain and a few immunohistochemical stain using several monoclonal antibody were performed . under the light microscope , the tumor was seen composed of spindle - shaped cells with prominent blood vessels and abundant intercellular collagen deposits ( fig . immunostaining by antibody ki-67 was almost negative , because the labeling index was below 0.5% ( fig . the other specific immunohistochemical staining was negative for epithelial membrane antigen , and positive for vimentin and s-100 . electromicroscopy revealed individual tumor cells surrounded by abundant collagen and nuclei of tumor cells were oval to elongated ( fig . the patient received no additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy , and was regularly followed up until 4 years after surgery . although she had recovered facial motor function to house - brackmann grade ii palsy , facial hypesthesia never fully recovered . until the last serial follow up mr , the detailed clinical information for a total of 32 patients published to date is shown in table 1 . although there is no clear consensus about this rare tumor concerning tumorigenesis , biological behavior , and prognosis , some common characteristics in the clinical , radiological , and histopathological aspects were found . first , gliofibromas have a tendency to affect children more than adults despite unknown predilection age6910111520 ) . among 32 patients , a female predominance of 2 : 1 has been noted by analysis of previous reports46 ) . furthermore , the majority of gliofibromas , with the exception of five cases in the infratentorial area and seven cases in the spinal cord , had a supratentorial location , although the tumor has been described as arising in both supratentorial and infratentorial areas61012 ) . second , some reports described radiological characteristics of gliofibromas , although no specific radiological features allowed a preoperative diagnosis of gliofibroma415 ) . ct shows a well - demarcated mass with heterogeneous or homogeneous contrast enhancement . on mr images , gliofibromas appear to have various signal intensities including iso- to hyperintense on t1wi , and hypo- to hyperintense on t2wi . in particular , such low signal intensity on t2wi is thought to result from the reflection of the dense connective tissues as one of the peculiar characteristics in gliofibromas . because these radiological findings include an extra - axial location , preoperative radiological misdiagnosis as a meningioma has been reported , as was the case in our patient6 ) . gliofibromas have peculiar ' biphasic ' features composed of glial and mesenchymal components69101215172022 ) . in our patient , the tumor clearly showed a similar biphasic appearance of mixed fibrillary astrocytes and mesenchymal components . for this reason , gliofibromas should be distinguished from other collagen - producing cns neoplasms such as gliosarcomas and desmoplastic infantile astrocytomas or gangliomas ( dia / dig)9101215 ) . although dia / dig have a prominent desmoplastic component similar to gliofibromas , it is usually a benign cystic tumor located on the brain surface and it has no mesenchymal component912 ) . moreover , gliofibroma can be distinguished from gliosarcoma by the absence of a clear - cut malignant mesenchymal component . although there are some exceptional cases , the majority of gliofibromas have a benign histology such as no necrosis , no microvascular proliferation , and a very low mib-1 labeling index like this case691012151620 ) . in addition , electron microscopic and chromosomal studies of gliofibromas have only been reported occasionally , and have not yet provided conclusive information . most of the published cases with gliofibroma presented a benign tumor nature , indolent clinical course , and showed no definite evidence of disease progression . though some patients underwent adjuvant treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy , the role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy is still controversial , and the prognosis of this rare tumor is not clearly understood . in our case , there was no disease progression during 4 years of follow - up , even if partially resected . however , long - term follow - up and more accumulated clinical experiences should be mandatory to understand this rare tumor . in this report , we presented a case of intracranial gliofibroma in a 61-year - old woman . it is rare tumor mostly reported from pediatric patients . also , it has characteristic biphasic microscopic morphology . we believe this case adds support to understanding more fully the nature and biological behavior of this rare tumor .\",\n",

up studies ( ct / mri ) due to logistic constraints . ta is a systemic disease of unknown origin , involving the aorta and its branches . the lesions are characterized by diffuse involvement requiring higher balloon pressures to dilate , with greater incidence of residual stenosis and a higher restenosis rate.9 angioplasty is the standard initial mode of treatment for aorta , renal , and subclavian artery stenosis caused by aortoarteritis.1012 its role in patients with a single patent arch artery presenting with severe cerebral ischemia is anecdotal.7 the lesions in chronic ta , without disease activity are often multifocal , long segment , usually involving the ostium and producing irregularity , stenosis , or even total occlusion.1,2 carotid artery involvement in ta is common ( 6%69% ) , with the left side more commonly involved than the right.3 lupi - herrera et al.1 showed that 6.8% of these patients developed hemiplegia and 4.5% had loss of vision at a mean follow - up of 33.2  37 months . both our patients had advanced stages of ta , presenting to us with its major sequelae . ours is a private teaching hospital and a tertiary referral center for patients in advanced stages of disease . many of our patients present to our center only with late manifestations of the disease . furthermore , both patients were from a lower socioeconomic background which may explain why they did not seek medical help during the early stages of the disease . the therapeutic options for these patients include surgical carotid endarterectomy or percutaneous carotid angioplasty.7,9,10 endarterectomy of a sole patent but stenosed carotid artery is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity.13 the one - year combined end point of all - cause mortality and major adverse events was 12.2% in the carotid stent group compared with 20.1% in the endarterectomy group.13 endarterectomy for ta is associated with high rates of morbidity , mortality , cranial nerve injury , anastomotic narrowing , graft occlusion , and aneurysm formation.13 both our patients had stenosis of the arch vessels , close to their origins from the aorta . surgical repair of such lesions often necessitates an intrathoracic approach , which would be more complex than a simple endarterectomy . in our clinical scenario of intervention for a single patent aortic arch artery with a severe stenosis , surgical repair was considered to have unacceptably high mortality and morbidity.14 hence , our first choice was angioplasty of the single patent but stenosed arch artery . we did not attempt angioplasty of the occluded vessels since angioplasty of chronically occluded carotid arteries is associated with poorer outcomes due to lower initial success and higher restenosis rates.8 in ta , higher balloon inflation pressures are often required for dilation as a result of transmural fibrosis . shorter lesions are associated with good results , whereas the longer segment stenoses tend to have incomplete dilatation and higher rates of restenosis . a self - expandable nitinol stent was used in the first patient as the result of balloon angioplasty was suboptimal . predilation of the lesion was done in a graded fashion , and following stenting , the stent was postdilated using a noncompliant balloon to reduce restenosis . cerebral protection devices may not be required in non - atherosclerotic fibrotic lesions such as fibromuscular dysplasia and ta because atheroembolization is unlikely.9 cutting balloon angioplasty may be beneficial in these fibrotic lesions , but financial constraints precluded the use of these devices . we reused angioplasty balloons and catheters ( cleaned and resterilized ) to keep the costs low . the safety and efficacy of reusing catheters has been documented earlier,1517 and this is a common practice in many centers . the self - expanding stent was a free donated stent . in order to maintain adequate cerebral protection and prevent convulsions due to cerebral ischemia as other arch vessels were occluded , balloon inflation durations were maintained under 10 seconds . in stenotic lesions of ta associated with neurological sequelae , angioplasty is a safer and more effective therapeutic option than medical therapy alone.7,9,10,18 this is especially so when disease activity is absent and in the presence of severe symptoms arising from its chronic vascular complications as seen in our patients . although the technique of carotid angioplasty presented here is not novel , our case series highlights the clinical fact that for patients with ta presenting with severe cerebral ischemia , and angiographic evidence of a single patent arch artery , revascularization of the single arch artery by angioplasty with or without stent placement is safe , effective , and a reasonable alternative to surgical therapy .',\n",

       " {'article': 'the majority of acute leukemia cases are classified as acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) or acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , based on morphologic , immunophenotypic , cytochemical , and genetic profiles of the blast cells . however , a minority of acute leukemias show no clear evidence of differentiation along a single lineage . these are now classified under acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage by the most recent who classification ( 2008 ) and account for < 4% of all cases of acute leukemia . they include leukemias with no lineage - specific antigens ( acute undifferentiated leukemias ) and those with blasts that express antigens of more than one lineage ( mixed phenotype acute leukemias [ mpals ] ) . the latter can either be leukemias with two distinct populations of blasts , each expressing antigens of a different lineage ( historically referred to as  bilineal  leukemias ) or a single blast population coexpressing antigens of multiple lineages ( historically referred to as  acute leukemias).1 coexpression of myeloid and b - lymphoid antigens is most common in mpal , followed by coexpression of myeloid and t - lymphoid antigens , accounting for 66%70% and 23%24% of mpals , respectively . coexpression of b- and t - lineage - associated antigens or antigens of all three lineages is exceedingly rare.2,3 the requirement for assigning more than one lineage to a single blast population has been established by current who classification . the bcr - abl1 rearrangement is the most frequent recurrent genetic abnormality occurring in mpal and considered a distinctive entity . it accounts for 20% of all mpal.1,4 mpal with t(9:22)(q34:q11.2 ) meets the diagnostic criteria for mpal with blasts bearing the t(9:22)(q34:q11.2 ) translocation or bcr - abl1 rearrangements in patients with no history of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) . the majority of cases occurring in adults have b / myeloid phenotype , while some show t / myeloid , b- and t - lineage , or trilineage leukemia . ph is a poor prognostic factor in mpal , with a reported median survival of eight months , which is significantly worse than that of patients of all types of mpal.4 we present an unusual case of adult mpal with immunologically two distinct blast cell subsets expressing b - all markers and cortical t markers . a male patient in his 20s with unremarkable previous clinical history presented for preemployment check up in november 2012 . the patient was referred to national centre for cancer care and research ( ncccr ) in qatar for further management . on admission , the patient looked sick , complaining of fever with chills , fatigue , cough , and dyspnea . his physical examination revealed pallor , fever , generalized mild lymph node enlargement , mild hepatosplenomegaly , and bilateral lung basal crackles . chest x - ray showed bilateral lung infiltrates and chest high - resolution computerized tomography ( ct ) scan showed ground glass opacity with patchy nodular infiltrate that is scattered in both lungs more pronounced in the mid and lower lung zones . ultrasound of the abdomen showed an enlarged liver and mild splenomegaly ( 14 cm ) . respiratory virus panel and septic workup were negative . a complete blood count ( cbc ) revealed anemia ( hemoglobin of 9.3 g / dl ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count of 28  10/l ) , and leukocytosis ( white blood cell count ( wbc ) of 11.2  10/l ) . the differential count showed 13% segmented neutrophils , 48% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 1% metamyelocytes , 2% myelocytes , and 34% blasts ( fig . the majority were medium -

lymphoblast . the other immature population comprising approximately 19% of total cells expressed cd45 ( moderate ) and t - cell markers , including ccd3 , cd7 , cd5 , cd2 , and cd1a . this population was negative for surface cd3 , tdt , cd34 , b , and myeloid markers ( fig . immunohistochemical studies on the core biopsy showed that the blasts were positive for cd34 , cd20 , pax 5 , cd79a , cd99 , cd10 , and tdt . based on the morphologic and immunophenotypic profiles , this case was diagnosed as mpal with two separate populations of blasts belonging to b- and t - lineages . conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on cultured bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis . the analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype with two clones . the main clone with 46 , xy with reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11.2 ) in 22/42 cells ( fig . the subclone was a near tetraploid ( 8088 chromosomes ) with multiple structural and numeric abnormalities , including double ph chromosome ( fig . 3b ) . fluorescent in situ hybridization ( fish ) analysis was performed on unstimulated interphase cells from bone marrow sample using probe lsi bcr - abl es dual color translocation probe ( vysis ) , which allows the distinction between major m - bcr / abl and minor m - bcr / abl gene rearrangements . the fish study revealed abnormal hybridization pattern with m - bcr / abl1 rearrangement in 46% ( 46/100 ) of examined cells . a second abnormal clone was also detected with a triple fusion pattern ( double fusion signal of the minor ( m)-bcr / abl1 rearrangement plus a third extra fusion signal corresponding to the presence of supernumerary ph chromosome ) in 16% of the cells analyzed ( fig . the patient was initially started on supportive measures , including iv fluids 1/2 ns 100 ml / hour , allopurinol 300 mg po daily , tazocin 4.5 g iv every eight hours , ciprofloxacin 400 mg iv every 12 hours , and voriconazole 6 mg / kg iv stat , and then 4 mg / kg . after three weeks , he improved from his lung infection and his cbc was normalized . molecular studies for bcr / abl p190 mrna by quantitative , reverse transcription pcr ( rt -

lineages ) . however , a small percentage shows more than one lineage or no specific lineage , which is designated as  acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage ,  which can either be an mpal combining phenotype of two or more lineages or  undifferentiated leukemia  without clear evidence of any lineage commitment . in addition , mpal may comprise a single population of blast expressing both specific myeloid and lymphoid antigens ( biphenotypic ) or be made up of two distinct populations , each expressing different lineage specific antigens . historically , a diagnosis of biphenotypic acute leukemia was made using the few available lineage - associated markers , which had spuriously shown an incidence of acute mixed leukemia to be as high as 20%).5 as more antibodies became available , it became clear that a significant proportion of aml and all cases expressed aberrant antigens.69 it became necessary to distinguish aberrant expression of an antigen(s ) from true   specific criteria were first proposed by arnoulet et al10 in the form of a scoring system based on weighted expression of antigens by blasts . in 2001 , the who expert group11 proposed a scoring system that is modified from the european group for the immunological characterization of leukemias ( egil ) scoring12 ( where a score of over 2 was required to assign a lineage ) . the current who ( 2008 ) classification , however , has replaced these scoring systems and relies upon lineage assignment based on specific criteria . currently , cytoplasmic cd3 is the most t - lineage specific antigen . to assign b - lineage , multiple antigenic expressions are required , which includes a strong cd19 along with strong expression of any one of cd79 , cd10 , and cytoplasmic cd22 . however , if cd19 is weakly expressed , then , strong expression of at least two of the aforementioned b antigens is necessary.1 using this recent who criterion , prevalence of mpal has been found to be 1.6% of acute leukemia.3 mpal usually are either t / myeloid or b / myeloid and less frequently b / t mpal . most of the cases of b / t mpal found in literature describe biphenotypic blasts rather than bilineal blasts4 as seen with our case . weir et al13 described 19 cases of acute bilineal leukemia over a 10-year period , but they did not report any case of b / t bilineal leukemia . in the present case , two separate populations of blasts were identified . the first population strongly expressed cd19 , cd79a , and cd10 without any evidence of cytoplasmic cd3 or other  t  antigens , thus fulfilling the criteria for b - lineage , while the second population expressed cytoplasmic cd3 , cd7 , cd5 , cd2 , and cd1a without any evidence cd19 or other  the study conducted by weir et al13 included only t / myeloid or b / myeloid blasts , where definite morphological differences existed between the two populations . the light scatter properties of these populations were sufficiently different to allow clear - cut recognition among them . the larger myeloid blasts had higher scatter as compared to smaller lymphoid blasts with a lower scatter . in contrast , our case had lymphoid blasts only , which made it difficult to differentiate the two different populations from the fsc vs ssc plot , while cd45 vs ssc discriminated the two populations with t blasts expressing cd45 stronger than b blasts . although the putative cell of origin for mpal is unknown , it is suggested that these arise from very early hematopoietic progenitors with a potential to grow either as myeloid or lymphoid . accordingly , the cases with b / myeloid and t / myeloid immunophenotypes would be in agreement with findings documented in fetal mice hemopoiesis that suggest the persistence of a myeloid potential in early b- and t - lymphoid precursors14 and the existence of a multipotent progenitor with b - cell , t - cell , and granulocyte / macrophage potential.15 the recognition of mpal with b- and t - cell lineages would support the proposed model of adult bone marrow hematopoiesis , where a common lymphoid progenitor is present.16 cytogenetic alterations reported in mpal are t(9;22 ) ( q34;q11 ) and 11q23 ( mll ) abnormalities . these two abnormalities have been observed so frequently that the newer who classification has acknowledged these as separate entities.1 in our case , chromosomal analysis revealed reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11.2 ) in 22/42 ( 52% ) cells analyzed ( fig . other additional cytogenetic abnormalities with near tetraploid cells ( 4n ) , double ph were identified in another 20 cells ( 47.6% ) . the fish analysis for bcr in addition , a second abnormal clone was detected with a triple fusion ( double ph ) in 16% of the cells analyzed . the location of the breakpoint within the bcr gene results in either the p190 protein observed in ph all ( 66.3% of the cases ) or the p210 protein common in patients with cml and in 31.2% of ph all . the remaining cases are associated either with both transcript type or with atypical transcripts.17 in our patient , bcr / abl p190 mrna transcript was detected supporting de novo all . hyperdiploid karyotypes with double ph are common in cml , with over 500 reported cases . in contrast , they are rare in all , and a total of 66 cases with double ph are reported in mitelman s catalog of chromosome aberrations in cancer ( http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/chromosomes/cytsearchform ) . of those , only 23 were associated with hyperdiploidy and , interestingly , only three patients showed more than two copies of the ph on conventional karyotyping . thomas et al18 found seven cases of double ph in 41 all ( 17% ) , and the presence of an extra ph was considered an initial parameter associated with a statistically significant worse prognosis . other additional chromosome aberrations were present in up to 79% of the cases in a large study of 209 patients.19 yanada et al20 study involving 77 all patients with ph , additional aberrations with a frequency of greater than 10% included a second ph chromosome ( + der ( 22 ) t(9,22 ) abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 9 , monosomy 7 , and trisomy 8) . the presence of additional aberrations was associated with significantly shorter relapse - free survival ( rfs ) and higher relapse rate . this was particularly pronounced for the + der ( 22 ) t(9,22 ) and abnormalities involving the short arm chromosome 9.19,20 in our case , other additional cytogenetic abnormalities were near tetraploid cells ( 4n ) and double philadelphia chromosomes were identified in another 20 cells ( 47.6% ) . since ph cases represent approximately 25% of all , cases with double ph should represent a smaller percentage of adult all.5 one case of mixed phenotyping acute leukemia ( two distinct population of blasts with b and t blast lineages ) , which showed t(9;22)(q34;q11 ) ( ph ) was reported . the present case describes mixed phenotype b / t acute leukemia with double philadelphia chromosomes and complex karyotype that represent an extremely rare disease , bcr - abl . controversies regarding the treatment of mpal include which induction protocol is to be used ( myeloid or lymphoid ) and whether induction is to be followed by stem cell transplantation or not . all - based treatments have been found to be more effective with higher response rate as compared to aml or aml all schedule.4 cases of mpal in pediatric patients showed a better response rate with all - based induction protocol compared with aml - based protocol ( cr of 83% vs cr of 52% ) . cases of mpal have shown poor outcomes probably because of adverse cytogenetic abnormalities associated with it , especially the presence of bcr - abl translocation.21 in addition , high incidence of cd34 positivity , high incidence of extramedullary infiltrate , lack of optimized guidelines for induction , and high incidence of relapse after remission has led to a lower overall survival and disease - free survival in patients of mpal.22 philadelphia chromosome - positive all have long been recognized as a high - risk subset of all . published data show a disappointing long - term survival of only 20% or less with chemotherapy alone23 with a median survival of eight months . the combination of bcr - abl1 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( imatinib or dasatinib ) chemotherapy has improved outcome with cr of 80%100% and five years survival in 35%50% range.24 nevertheless , ph diseases remain a poor prognosis subgroup with unacceptable high relapse rate . because of the poor outcome with chemotherapy , the allogeneic stem cell transplantation hematopoitic stem cell transplant ( hsct ) in first complete remission ( cr1 ) remains the standard of care in most centers and is considered to be the treatment of choice in adult ph all.4 cases of mpal b / t - lymphoid are exceedingly rare and with the exception of the present case not with double ph have been described . our case has responded well with all - based treatment plus dasatinib and subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and remains in complete remission 18 months following initial diagnosis . but a longer follow - up is required to draw the inference on the treatment effect . mixed phenotype b / t acute leukemia is an extremely rare disease , particularly those with double ph chromosomes and clinically presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment . chemotherapy ( hyper cvad plus tkis ) followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplant in such patients may give good results in patients with this rare type of acute leukemia .',\n",

sayre syndrome.8 deficiency of dihydrofolate reductase , the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate , causes cerebral folate deficiency with generalized tonic - clonic and focal seizures and megaloblastic anemia or pancytopenia.9 the csf 5-mthf levels tend to be less profoundly low in these cases as well as in those associated with folate receptor antibodies ( fra ) . cerebral folate deficiency has been shown to be strongly associated with autism or autistic spectrum disorders ( asd ) , the features were seen in our cases as well . in one large series of 93 asd patients , all 16 csf 5-mthf values were below the normative mean csf concentration , 75.3% of all 93 patients had fr auto antibodies ( fra ) in the serum samples , and an inverse relationship between the blocking fra and csf 5-mthf was found . approximately one - third of these , treated with folinic acid demonstrated moderate to much improvement in this study.10 the 5-mthf is the precursor of the methyl - group donor s - adenosylmethionine , which is used in more than 100 chemical reactions . the methylation of arginine at position 107 within myelin basic protein is necessary to maintain stability of cns myelin , and this might explain the hypomyelination seen in our cases . biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin is also dependent on 5-mthf,5 and low levels of the later might be associated with low 5-hiaa , and hva concentrations . we did not find low levels of these 2 in our patients , as with other cases.3,8 our patients did not show the reduced choline and inositol peak on brain mrs as previously seen in some cases.3,5 in conclusion , patients presenting with intractable seizures beyond the neonatal period , especially in the setting of otherwise , unexplained global developmental delay or of features consistent with autistic spectrum disorder calls for consideration of cerebral folate deficiency . as only a limited number of cases are reported yet , more cases in the future will help us study the phenotype and better characterization of this new clinical entity . case reports will only be considered for unusual topics that add something new to the literature . written informed consent for publication must accompany any photograph in which the subject can be identified . figures should be submitted with a 300 dpi resolution when submitting electronically or printed on high -

       " {'article': 'in addition to ideal occlusion , adequate gingival display with a harmonious gingival line , balanced smile arc , and ideal buccal corridor are key factors for an esthetic smile and facial attractiveness.12 excessive gingival display , also known as  gummy smile ,  is characterized by excessive exposure of the maxillary gingiva while smiling . gingival display of more than 2 mm while smiling is considered excessive and unattractive.34 gummy smile is caused by skeletal disharmony , such as vertical and horizontal excess of the maxilla or the maxillary dentition , which , in many cases , accompanies a functional imbalance of soft tissues , such as the upper lip or elevating muscles.56 thus , in general , various intrusion or surgical mechanics are applied to reduce the vertical dimension of the maxillary arch or maxilla based on the etiology and severity of the malocclusion.7 however , changes in the vertical exposure of the maxillary anterior teeth may also influence the smile arc esthetics in the transverse dimension . from a clinical perspective , excessive intrusion of the maxillary anterior teeth produces a flat or reverse smile arc , which is considered unattractive and less esthetic than is a consonant smile arc.8 among the various intrusion mechanics applied during orthodontic treatment , the application of temporary anchorage devices ( tads ) is well known for its effectiveness in the intrusion of the anterior or posterior teeth.9101112 in addition to selective regional intrusion , a biomechanical approach has been proposed in order to achieve full - arch intrusion along with distalization in the maxillary dentition by applying multiple interdental miniscrews ( i.e. , 2 miniscrews on each side ) . dual force vectors allow the line of action to pass through the center of resistance ( cr ) of the entire maxillary arch and facilitate the retraction and intrusion of the entire dentition without changes in the occlusal plane.13 herein , we report the treatment outcome with follow - up results of an adult patient with skeletal class ii malocclusion who was concerned about her unesthetic smile . after a thorough evaluation of smile esthetics , we applied total maxillary intrusion combined with distalization to establish ideal occlusion and to improve the smile esthetics as well as soft - tissue profile . a 25-year - old woman visited the clinic with the chief complaint of an unattractive and awkward smile and lip protrusion . however , excessive gingival display , crowding , and relatively large buccal corridors were noted at full smile . an intraoral examination indicated deep overbite ( 4 mm ) and class ii canine and molar relationship . the maxillary arch form was narrow and tapered with a decreased intercanine width of 31.4 mm compared to the normal width of 33.7 mm.14 the mandibular arch showed a deep curve of spee ( figures 1 and 2 ) . the initial radiographic evaluation indicated mild flattening of both the condyles with relatively short ramal height . the cephalometric analysis showed a skeletal class ii relationship with a retrognathic mandible ( sella - nasion - a point [ sna ] , 77.2 ; sellanasion - b point [ snb ] , 70.6 ; a point - nasion - b point [ anb ] , 6.6 ) and a hyperdivergent profile ( mandibular plane angle , 49.0 ) . because of the retrusive mandible , the upper and lower lips protruded 3.9 and 4.2 mm , respectively , to the e - line . the maxillary incisors were retroclined ( u1 to sn , 93.5 ) and the mandibular incisors were proclined ( impa , 100.9 ) ( figure 3 ) . since the patient s chief complaint was focused on the unattractive smile , we additionally evaluated the smile esthetics . at full smile , she had excessive gingival display ( > 3.5 mm ) , but the smile arc was consonant to the lower lip . the overall vertical proportion of the middle 1/3 of the face ( g - sn / sn - me ) and the maxilla ( n - ans / ans - me ) were within normal boundaries at 1.2 and 0.8 , respectively , whereas the distance from the maxillary incisor tip to the nasal floor ( u1 to nasal floor ) and maxillary incisor show ( u1 to stms ) were high at 34.4 and 5.0 mm , respectively . these findings indicated that the main cause of excessive gingival display was the overeruption of the maxillary incisors rather than the vertical growth of the maxilla.15 periodontal analysis revealed no specific sign of gingival hyperplasia , and the probing depth was within normal range ( < 3 mm ) . the patient displayed a thick flat biotype , with a crown width / length ratio of 1.0 , indicating a shorter crown height than crown width . the buccal corridor ratio ( calculated as the difference between the visible maxillary dentition width and the inner commissure width divided by the inner commissure width ) was 25% , which was relatively large compared to the esthetic normal ratio of 1015%.16 along with the tapered arch form , the lingual crown torque of the maxillary canines and premolars was excessive at 9 and 12 , respectively , when compared to the normal torque of 0.8 and 6.3 , respectively , for koreans.17 the excessive lingual crown torque of the canines and premolars negatively affects smile esthetics.18 on the basis of these findings , the patient was diagnosed with a hyperdivergent skeletal class ii malocclusion and an unesthetic smile . the treatment objectives were ( 1 ) to improve the smile esthetics by reducing excessive gingival display and buccal corridors while maintaining an ideal smile arc ; ( 2 ) to improve facial esthetics ; and ( 3 ) to establish functional occlusion . since the malocclusion and associated lip protrusion were mainly caused by the retrusive mandible / chin with a steep mandibular plane angle , the first treatment option was to combine orthognathic surgery for advancing the mandible with the extraction of the mandibular premolars . along with mandibular advancement , maxillary impaction can be considered to reduce the excessive gingival display and to ensure stability . these surgical approaches may improve the overall facial profile and the gummy smile per se.19 however , the main cause of the unesthetic smile had a dentoalveolar origin rather than a skeletal origin , and the expected final occlusion after surgery would be a class iii molar relationship . the main objective of the camouflage treatment would be to reduce lip protrusion ( sagittal ) and to improve the smile esthetics ( vertical and transverse ) . according to the visualized treatment objective , an approximately 3-mm retraction of the incisors was needed to ensure an ideal incisor position against the a - pog line and facial plane ( table 1 ) . conventionally , the extraction of 4 premolars has been an effective option to control the sagittal and vertical problems . however , considering the small arch length discrepancy , over 4 mm of anchorage loss was expected after premolar extractions . in addition , in the transverse dimension , it was necessary to upright the canines and premolars which showed excessive lingual crown torque in order to increase the width of the smile and to decrease the buccal corridors.18 however , if this treatment option were selected , the changes in the arch form would eventually have resulted in more residual space . the third option was to distalize both the arches to improve lip protrusion along with vertical control by using skeletal anchorage.20 the anatomic space available at the maxillary tuberosity distal to the maxillary second molars ( 3.6 mm on the right , and 8.9 mm on the left ) as well as the distance to the anterior border of the ramus ( 4.3 mm on the right , and 7.2 mm on the left ) and that to the inner lingual cortex from the mandibular second molars ( 3.0 mm on the right , and 1.7 mm on the left ) were sufficient to withhold the amount of necessary distalization with the extraction of the third molars ( figure 4).21 in addition , the use of buccal interradicular miniscrews during distalization biomechanically results in buccal uprighting of the canines and premolars with mild arch expansion.10 since the patient s smile arc was consonant to the mandibular lip line , maxillary anterior intrusion alone may flatten the smile arc , which would make the patient look older and drastically reduce the smile attractiveness ratings.8 thus , to specifically maintain the consonant smile arc , total intrusion of the maxillary dentition without changing the occlusal plane was planned with the use of multiple miniscrews.13 this plan would improve the lip protrusion and smile esthetics without affecting the ideal smile arc . it would also produce a total impaction - like effect on the maxilla , which may be advantageous to the profile because of the counterclockwise rotation of the mandible . the three treatment options were discussed with the patient . since the frontal smile esthetics and lip protrusion were the main concerns of the patient , option 3 after the extraction of the third molars , 0.018-slot self - ligation brackets ( clippy c ; tomy inc . , tokyo , japan ) were bonded on both the arches , and sequential nickel - titanium wires were used for leveling and alignment . in the maxilla , distalization and intrusion of the complete maxillary dentition the distalizing force applied from a single miniscrew inserted at the level of the mucogingival junction between the first molar and second premolar to the retraction hook of a rigid maxillary archwire results in total distalization of the dentition . however , it may also result in mild clockwise rotation of the occlusal plane.13 thus , to overcome this biomechanical issue and to induce a  total impaction - like effect  without changes in the occlusal plane , additional miniscrews were inserted between the premolars to create a line of force that passes near the cr of the maxillary arch ( figure 5a).13 the interradicular space between the premolars and the molar were 2.5 and 2.6 mm ( right side ) , respectively , and 2.3 and 1.7 mm ( left side ) , respectively , at the mucogingival junction , approximately 4 mm above the cementoenamel junction . considering the possibility of root contact along with total arch distalization , the miniscrews were inserted at the midpoint between adjacent teeth at 45 angulation relative to the occlusal plane at the level of the mucogingival junction , as described in previous studies.22 four tapered miniscrews 7.0 mm in length and 1.6 mm in coronal diameter ( orlus ; ortholution , seoul , korea ) were inserted with two screws on each side . a 0.016  0.022-inch stainless - steel flat arch wire was engaged using crimpable hooks located between the maxillary lateral incisor and canine and between the canine and first premolar . a distal driving force of 200 g was applied using elastomeric chains from each miniscrew to the hook in order to deliver the intrusive and distalizing force vector passing near the estimated cr ( figure 5b and 5c).13 at 9 months , a mild curve of spee was added to the main archwire to compensate for the mild torque changes over the following 3 months . in the mandible , a one - piece intrusion arch was applied to relieve the curve of spee after initial alignment . after 12 months of treatment , an interim evaluation of gingival display and lip protrusion was performed . despite a great reduction in gingival display while smiling , without any changes in the ideal consonant smile arc , sagittal correction was necessary to improve lip protrusion . the miniscrews ( orlus ) were also inserted between the mandibular second premolar and first molar with a 45 angulation relative to the occlusal plane . full - arch distalization was continued for another 6 months in both the arches ( figure 5d and 5e ) . although her oral hygiene was ideal and the probing depth did not exceed 3 mm throughout the treatment period , the gingival margin of the maxillary incisors became uneven , and the crown width / length ratio slightly increased from 1.0 to 1.03 possibly due to the large amount of intrusion in the maxillary dentition . therefore , gingivoplasty was performed on the maxillary incisors to recontour the gingival margins ( figures 5f and 5 g ) . fixed lingual retainers were bonded to the lingual surfaces of both the arches , and circumferential retainers were used full time for the first 6 months . the facial and smile esthetics along with the lateral profile were improved with the treatment . an ideal gingival display while smiling was achieved and the consonant smile arc was maintained after treatment . the occlusion was completed with a class i canine and molar relationship along with ideal overjet and overbite . the height of the gingival margins was even , and the crown width / length ratio was reduced to 0.8 . the patient was fully satisfied with the treatment outcome ( figures 6 , 7 , 8) . the cephalometric superimposition revealed significant total intrusion and distalization of the maxillary arch without changes in the occlusal plane . counterclockwise rotation of the mandible could be induced , and it resulted in mild advancement of the pogonion and soft - tissue pogonion , as well as slight reduction of the anterior facial height . lip prominence was reduced by 2.3 and 3.5 mm in the upper and lower lips , respectively , after full - arch distalization ( figure 9 ) . cone - beam computed tomography ( cbct ) images taken before and after treatment were superimposed on the cranial base . it indicated total impaction of the maxillary dentition along with counterclockwise rotation of the mandible . specifically , the maxillary incisors were intruded 2.0 mm and distalized 3.0 mm from the initial position while maintaining the incisor torque , whereas the maxillary molars were intruded 2 mm and distalized 2.5 mm on the right side and 3.5 mm on the left side . in the mandible , the incisors were intruded 2.0 mm and uprighted 2.0 mm , whereas the molars were distalized and uprighted by 2.0 mm along with the distal tip of the mandibular second molars ( figrue 10 ) . along with tooth movement , changes in the arch form , including flattening of the anterior arch , were noted in both the arches ( figure 11 ) . the position of both the condyles was maintained throughout the treatment ( figure 12 ) . however , the overall position of the incisors was within the biological boundaries , and the torque was maintained ( figure 13 ) . the patient did not comply with the directions regarding the use of the removable retainers . nevertheless , the occlusion and smile esthetics were stably maintained throughout the follow - up period . she maintained excellent oral hygiene , and her periodontal condition was ideal ( figure 14 ) . superimposition analyses performed at debonding and after 15 months of follow - up did not indicate any clinical significance ( figure 15 ) . when the intraoral aspects of the occlusion per se are evaluated , the patient in the present case may be considered as having a simple class ii deepbite malocclusion . however , the diagnosis based on the smile esthetics revealed problems in the vertical ( excessive gingival display , but with a consonant smile arc ) and transverse planes ( large buccal corridors ) in addition to the sagittal ( lip protrusion and class ii relationship ) plane . therefore , three - dimensional ( 3d ) tooth movement was planned to improve both the static and functional smile esthetics . simple biomechanics like tads can be applied to achieve 3d movement of the whole dentition without concerns regarding anchorage or patient compliance . the cr of the whole maxillary dentition is suggested to be near the middle area of the premolar roots.23 from a biomechanical perspective , a line of distalization force applied from the tads to the maxillary arch by using hooks between the canine and lateral incisor passes below the cr point , because the tads are frequently inserted in the attached gingival zone between the maxillary first and second premolars . this may steepen the occlusal plane and clinically aggravate the gummy smile.10,24 thus , we applied two additional miniscrews , one on each side between the premolars , and applied individual forces to the 2 hooks on each side to ensure that the line of action passes close to the cr ( figure 5).13 as a result , simultaneous total distalization and intrusion of the maxillary dentition was effectively achieved , thereby improving both the smile esthetics as well as the occlusion . traditionally , orthodontists have focused more heavily on the views of the face from the lateral aspect than do most other viewers . however , facial attractiveness correlates more highly to smiling photographs than to profile photographs.25 considering the patient s needs and esthetic concerns , the smile esthetics were monitored throughout the treatment period , and the treatment outcome was evaluated in the transverse , vertical , and sagittal planes . in the transverse plane , the use of dual buccal interradicular miniscrews broadened the arch form , as has been suggested in previous reports.26 thus , the buccal corridor ratio at smile improved from 25% to 15% , which was close to the ideal ratio of 1015%.14 initially , the patient had a narrow tapered arch form with excessive lingual crown torque in the maxillary canine and premolars . in such cases , buccal uprighting of the canines and premolars is recommended to widen the smile and reduce the buccal corridors.18 buccal uprighting of the canine and premolars results in arch expansion . however , unlike the conventional arch expansion in adults , which is well known for its instability , buccal uprighting shows high long - term stability.27 from a biomechanical perspective , we utilized buccal miniscrews , which eventually result in buccal tipping throughout the treatment process . accordingly , the excessive lingual crown torque was normalized , and the change in the arch form was beneficial . however , for patients with a broad arch form or narrow buccal corridors , careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unwanted changes in arch width as the treatment progresses . in the vertical plane , excessive gingival display at smile and incisor show at rest were reduced to the ideal norms,2 whereas the ideal smile arc was maintained through total intrusion of the maxillary arch . however , following the large amounts of intrusion , the clinical crown height was also reduced by an average of 0.4 mm per tooth . this decrease in clinical crown height may have been due to the inability of the gingival complex to keep up with the speed of apical tooth movement.28 the response of the periodontal tissue following intrusion is highly related to the standard of oral hygiene.29 experimental studies have shown that the clinical crown height may decrease because of gingival accumulation after intrusion without visual and histologic signs of inflammation.28 the patient maintained excellent oral hygiene ; however , gingivoplasty was recommended after orthodontic treatment to improve the microesthetics of the maxillary incisors . the unevenness of the gingival margins became symmetric and the crown width and height ratio improved after gingivoplasty . from a biological perspective , large amounts of intrusion may also be associated with apical root resorption.3031 in this patient , relatively mild apical root resorption occurred after a 2-mm anterior and molar intrusion . in the sagittal plane , although the large skeletal discrepancies remained unchanged and resulted in limited outcome of the camouflage treatment , we tried to improve lip protrusion and the class ii relationship through full - arch distalization and intrusion . since the patient had a third molar space available distal to the second molars and approximately 3 mm from the roots to the lingual cortical plate , which is considered an anatomic limit for mandibular distalization,2032 tooth movement per se was effectively achieved through the application of a distal force from the miniscrews . in our case , a total intrusion of 2 mm induced minor counterclockwise rotation of the mandible and advancement of the pogonion . although the amount of counterclockwise rotation in response to the amount of maxillary intrusion is difficult to predict precisely , it is without doubt advantageous in terms of the profile esthetics and vertical control in cases of class ii high - angle malocclusions.1011 however , although the patient showed a significantly high mandibular plane angle in the sagittal view , she may well be categorized as having a brachyfacial type in the frontal view because of the relatively high facial width and interzygoma distance . in addition , the proportion of the lower 1/3 to the total facial height or to the midface was harmonious initially . thus , an excessive decrease of lower facial height through counterclockwise rotation should always be monitored in the frontal plane because it may negatively affect the facial proportions . cbct superimposition to the cranial base was used to validate the treatment outcome in all 3 dimensions . not only did it enable the observation of changes in the sagittal plane similar to the conventional superimposition , but it also enabled the measurement of the extent of individual tooth movement , as well as the changes in the transverse arch dimension and soft - tissue profile.32 precise anatomical evaluation , such as that of the condylar position following counterclockwise rotation , the presence of root resorption , and the surrounding alveolar housing , as well as follow - up evaluation confirmed that the treatment results were satisfactory and stable . to improve smile esthetics , smile was monitored in the transverse , vertical , and sagittal planes . the findings of this case study show that total intrusion and distalization of the maxillary dentition by using multiple tads is a viable option for the treatment of skeletal class ii malocclusion associated with excessive gingival display and large buccal corridors .',\n",

t3 ( 66ng / dl ) , t4 ( 5.3g / dl ) , f - t4 ( 0.29g / dl ) and tsh ( 32.3 u / ml ) ( table 1 ) . the dosage of desiccated thyroid was increased to 60 mg and serum tsh level became low level . in may , 1991 , thyroid function test showed normal serum total thyroid hormone , suppressed tsh and low free t4 levels . thereafter her compliance of taking drugs was insufficient . on admission , ( in august , 1992 ) , she appeared clinically to be myxoedematous because of puffy face and non - pitting leg edema . on physical examination , the body temperature was 36.5c , pulse rate 72 beats per minute and regular , and blood pressure 132/70mmhg . urinalysis , hemogram , levels of electrolytes , blood urea nitrogen , blood glucose , uric acid , cholesterol and liver function were within normal limits . tsh was still suppressed despite low level of t4 ( 1.6g / dl ) , t3(15ng / dl ) , free t4(0.15ng / dl ) and free t3 ( below 0.4 ) . serum tbg level was 20.5g / ml and anti - thyroglobulin , microsome antibodies , tsh receptor antibody and anti - tsh antibody were negative . as shown in table 2 , a significant increase in serum tsh levels did not occur after drip infusion ( 2 mg ) of trh for 30 minutes . after repeated injection of trh ( 2mg / day ) for 4 consecutive days , serum tsh levels were still suppressed ( maximum level : 1.45u / ml in 120 minutes of final injection day ) . with the final trh injection , combined pituitary stimulation test by intravenous injection of 0.1 units / kg reglar insulin , 0.1 mg lh - rh was performed . growth hormone ( gh ) , lh , fsh , prolactin ( prl ) and cortisol kept almost normal responses ( table 2 ) . isolated tsh deficiency was first reported in 1953 by shuman . since then , more than 30 patients with isolated tsh deficiency have been reported . these patients were diagnosed by exogenous trh administration test and the direct determination of tsh in serum . recently , the advance of endocrinology and radiology is explaining the pathogenesis of isolated tsh deficiency , which is classified as disorders of pituitary lesion associated with central hypothyroidism . the pituitary causes can be broadly divided into mass lesions , infiltrative diseases , pituitary atrophy due to necrosis or autoimmune destruction and idiopathic tsh deficiency . the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic tsh deficiency are to satisfy 1 ) low serum levels of thyroid hormones , 2 ) low or undetectable tsh levels , 3 ) no tsh response to exogenous trh , 4 ) no evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies , 5 ) no abnormalities on radiographic studies . our case first occurred undetectable tsh and low ft4 before the operation of functioning adenoma , and abruptly became hypothyroidism with transient rise of tsh . when the dose of desiccated thyroid was increased , serum t4 and t3 normalized , in spite of low free t4 and suppressed tsh level . it is assumed that isolated tsh deficiency in adult populations shows commonly absent or mild symptoms of hypothyoidism . finally , she had various symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigability , puffy face , leg edema and cardiomegaly because of insufficiently taking drugs . the tsh values were measured many times by means of immunoradiometric assay ( irma ) and the results were almost the same . the characteristic finding of hypothalamic hypothyroidism is that a significant secretion of tsh occurs following repeated injection of trh . in hypothalamic hypothyroidism , normal responsiveness of tsh to trh usually persists despite of many years continuing pituitary hypofunction . high basal level of growth hormone in our case may be due to her poor nutrition . the responsiveness of pituitary hormones , except of rtsh , were intact and the brain mri showed no abnormality . though the etiology of isolated tsh deficiency was speculated as genetic origin , it is not true in our case as she had no family history and had once experienced the tsh elevation in 1990 . thus , we diagnosed our patient as acquired and idiopathic isolated tsh deficiency based on these findings . the relationship between thyroid functioning adenoma and pituitary hypothyroidism is unknown and the cause of the disease remains obscure , though arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and autoimmune damage to the anterior pituitary may be suggested as possible causes .',\n",

therefore , it is essential to diagnose bronchial obstruction by bronchoscopy . computed tomography is helpful for the differentiation of bronchial kinking from lung torsion in a patient with bronchial obstruction . the final diagnosis can be made during the operation by an inspection of the lung parenchyma . in a patient with severe congestion or definitive gangrene early diagnosis is the most important for the treatment of bronchial kinking or lung torsion . thus , bronchoscopy should be performed as soon as possible , whenever there are clinical signs of bronchial obstruction to rule out bronchial kinking or lung torsion . however , more serious complications such as bronchial wall perforation , stent migration , granuloma formation , and bacterial colonization may occur . surgical correction is the definitive treatment , and surgical diagnosis is one of the important roles of surgery . when obstructive pneumonia is combined , protection of the contralateral lung while positioning the patient in a lateral decubitus position is warranted during surgery . in the present case , we decided on vats exploration and surgical correction because an intraoperative diagnosis of congestion or gangrene formation was necessary . repositioning of the lower lobe was necessary and effective in relieving bronchial kinking . by repositioning , we could also restore the pulmonary artery and vein to a more neutral position . bronchopexy was also effective in maintaining a normal shape of the bronchus after resolving the kinking . reattachment of the pulmonary ligament was done to prevent excessive displacement of the lower lobe . to prevent bronchial kinking during the initial operation , reattachment of the pulmonary ligament after pulmonary ligament lymph node dissection less extensive dissection of lymph nodes around the lower lobar bronchus may prevent acute reverse v - shaped bronchial kinking . in conclusion , given that bronchial kinking can occur after an upper lobectomy , bronchial kinking should be one of the differential diagnoses in patients with signs of bronchial obstruction .',\n",

free until 15 days postoperatively . the doctors at his local hospital were unable to find the etiology of his postoperative pain . a ct scan was done that showed a heterogeneous mass in the left suprarenal region , suggestive of a residual mass that was infiltrating the posterior abdominal wall and muscle . a whole abdomen contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( nonionic cect ) revealed a devascularized left kidney possibly due to left renal artery injury . after various inconclusive testing , the patient was referred to irch ( aiims . ) at the time of the patient 's presentation at irch his condition had progressively worsened . he had developed bilateral paralysis , severe lower lumbar back pain , and bilateral leg pain . many investigations were initiated which included complete blood count ( cbc ) , liver function tests , complete metabolic panel , blood test checking for thyroid -

making skills , and the ability to apply these skills to various health - related situations . the development of health literacy should be considered as a way of improving overall health through proper communication . if consent was provided more appropriate pain management directed procedures could have been performed to bring the pain from 4/10 to possibly 2/10 or lower . in the 21 century , medical advancements have left us with little to none untreatable conditions . if we could increase the global health literacy , we would be able to help patients with treatable conditions . this case has shown me that even treatable conditions and in - depth explanations to patients can not overcome the deep - rooted lack of health literacy ( via fear of treatment modalities and possible side - effects ) that interferes with proven treatments of various illnesses .\",\n",

however , they are associated with a disproportionately high mortality rate . the tumor - node - metastasis ( tnm ) staging does not apply to gliomas as these tumors rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes or distant sites outside of the central nervous system ( 3 ) . they are considered the most malignant and aggressive of all brain tumors ( 13 , 5 , 6 ) . incidence increases with age and is about three cases per 100,000 annually in the us . median age at diagnosis of gbm is 64 years and about 6,000 new cases occur annually in patients older than age 65 in the us . the median overall survival for patients with glioblastoma is approximately 15 months , but in patients greater than 65 , median survival is reduced to 4 months , likely due to multiple underlying comorbidities ( 1 , 7 ) . glioblastomas occur mostly in cerebral hemispheres but may occur sub - tentorially in the brainstem or cerebellum ( 6 ) . a minority of cases are multifocal , mimicking brain metastases , as in our case . these are characterized by infiltrating growth , thereby making the tumor mass not clearly distinguishable from the normal tissue ; however , metastasis from gbm is rare due to the protective covering from meninges , the rapid tumor growth , and short course of the disease ( 6 ) . clinical presentation depends on the location of the tumor and the anatomic structures involved ( 3 ) . common symptoms include headache , seizure , motor weakness , and focal neurological deficits like hemiparesis , aphasia , ataxia , sensory loss , hemianopia , cranial nerve dysfunction , or frequent syncope , which develop over days to weeks ( 3 , 4 ) . our patient presented with recurrent falls , ataxia , left facial droop and hemiparesis , hoarse voice , dysphagia , and weight loss . rapidly growing glioblastomas may present with signs of increased intracranial pressure , such as headache associated with nausea and vomiting ( 3 ) . due to non - specific symptoms , gbm may be initially diagnosed as infection , inflammatory , circulatory or immunologic process ( 4 ) . mri is the standard imaging modality to diagnose and monitor glioblastomas ( 3 , 4 ) . tumor necrosis and hemorrhage on mri are highly suggestive of glioblastoma ; however , imaging findings are often non - specific and pose a challenge to differentiation from brain metastasis , as in our case ( 6 ) . definite diagnosis is made from the histopathological examination of the resected tumor or the biopsy specimen . such tumors are highly vascular , and necrotic foci are one of their most characteristic features ( 4 ) . treatment is multimodal , whenever possible , using surgical resection , radiation , chemotherapy , and targeted therapies with the overall goal of extending survival while maintaining quality of life ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) . because glioblastoma has high proliferative activity and infiltrates surrounding tissues , complete resection is not always possible and radiotherapy may not always be effective ( 4 ) . nevertheless , surgical resection is the first - step treatment ( 1 , 3 ) . however , surgery may not always be feasible due to its location and proximity to vital structures . in such cases , biopsy is needed to establish the definitive diagnosis and the histologic tumor grade , which are essential to formulate the treatment plan ( 3 ) . standard treatment recommendations after resection or biopsy in the elderly population are limited by a paucity of patients over the age of 65 in clinical trials ( 1 ) . presently , following resection or biopsy , radiation therapy concurrent with daily temozolomide is pursued , followed by adjuvant monthly temozolomide , provided no tumor progression is observed ( 1 , 3 ) . surgery and radiation have individually been shown to improve progression - free survival and overall survival , in the limited trials data available in the elderly population . additonally , use of radiation has not been shown to induce cognitive decline , a frequently expressed concern by elderly patients , in subgroup analyses of patients older than 70 years , in the admittedly underpowered trials done to date ( 810 ) . temozolomide alone may be a reasonable alternative in elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma ( 1 ) . mgmt promoter - methylated tumors have been shown to have significantly better median overall survival with administration of temozolomide ( 1 ) . our patient failed to improve symptomatically with chemoradiation , which is expected with his absence of mgmt promoter methylation within the tumor . monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab , rna interference , immunotherapy with vaccines from autologous dendritic cell , and hormone treatment are other treatment modalities under investigation ( 4 ) . despite combined modality treatment , recurrence is the rule and the treatment options are very limited ( 3 ) . continued research and development of new molecular and targeted immunotherapy are required for better understanding and treatment of this highly lethal tumor ( 2 , 4 ) . glioblastoma ( who grade iv ) is a highly aggressive and fatal brain tumor despite aggressive treatment . it occurs , especially in the elderly population who already have multiple comorbidities and tend to do worse than the non - elderly patients . whenever feasible , combined modality with surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy should be instituted ; however , temozolomide alone may be the reasonable alternative , especially if mgmt promoter methylation is present . further research is required for development of treatment that can prolong survival as well as ensure quality of life in the elderly population who often have multiple comorbidities . the author / authors has / have not received any funding or benefits from industry or elsewhere to conduct this study .',\n",

block appliance  to aid in mandibular advancement enabling correction of the sagittal skeletal discrepancy initially . the case would be reassessed for further dental treatment after completion of the functional phase . the functional appliance was a two - piece type with separate upper and lower components fabricated in heat - cured acrylic resin .  twin - block  functional appliance used in the patient the patient reported with a diffuse swelling measuring approximately 40 mm in height and 53 mm in length on the left side of the face in the submandibular region after a period of 40 days [ figures 1b and 2b ] . case history revealed that the swelling developed over a period of 3 days with no signs of any respiratory tract infection or fever . on extraoral examination , a single , diffuse nonmovable swelling was observed in the left submandibular region which was nontender on palpation and firm in consistency . intraoral examination showed no lesions , ulcerations or any tooth - related anomaly [ figure 3b ] . salivary gland duct evaluation showed no abnormality with no history of  meal time syndrome .  lymph node examination of the body in general was carried out to rule out generalized lymphadenopathy . the only positive clinical finding was a slight reduction in mouth opening owing to the swelling present in the region . diagnostic iopas of the developing second molar regions as well as an opg were recorded [ figure 5 ] . the patient was advised investigations including a complete blood picture , ultrasonographic ( usg ) evaluation of the left submandibular gland region [ figure 6 ] and a fnac . the blood reports were nonspecific with the only significant finding being a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate . usg scan revealed that the left submandibular gland was slightly enlarged as compared to the right with altered echotexture and increased vascularity on color doppler . enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted at levels i mainly and few in level ii and iii during usg examination , with the largest one measuring 2.3 cm  1.0 cm . acid - fast bacillus smear and mantoux test were done to rule out tuberculosis , and the test results were negative no relevant findings evident on orthopantomogram examination ultrasound of left submandibular gland a final diagnosis of reactive lymphadenopathy with submandibular gland sialadenitis was given . after discussion with an oral surgeon , a period of observation without using any medication and temporary discontinuation of the appliance was decided on . the patient reported to the clinic 3 days later without any swelling which was surprising considering its size on initial presentation . as a matter of precaution , orthodontic appliance therapy was temporarily halted for another 3 weeks . the patient started wearing the removable functional appliance after completion of the period of observation . lymphadenopathy is a term that describes an abnormality in either size , consistency or number of lymph nodes . it can be broadly classified as either generalized or localized . generalized lymphadenopathy requires the involvement of at least two or more noncontiguous areas while localized involves only one area . there are various causes for lymphadenopathy ranging from infections , immunologic disorders , malignancies , drug reactions , etc . , [ table 1 ] . the most common cause for submandibular lymphadenopathy is infections of the head , neck , sinuses , ears , eyes , scalp and pharynx . less common causes for submandibular lymphadenopathy include malignancies or immunologic disorders such as sjogren 's syndrome . causes of lymphadenopathy all dental biomaterials release substances into the oral cavity to a varying degree . the biological reactions between dental biomaterials and the oral mucosa can take place at a local level or far from the site of contact . most components of these materials are of low - molecular weight . by acting as haptens and combining with body proteins , methyl methacrylate ( mma ) is a widely used monomer in dentistry and has been reported to cause various abnormalities such as irritation to skin , eyes and mucous membranes , allergic dermatitis , stomatitis , asthma , neuropathy , disturbances of central nervous system , liver toxicity and fertility problems . thus , the monomer from the mma acts as a hapten sensitizing the t - lymphocytes which in turn undergo clonal expansion leading to lymphadenopathy . delayed hypersensitivity reactions ( type iv ) hypersensitivity is involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and infectious disorders . it may also be caused by foreign antigens such as chemicals and heavy metals . the reaction time take in delayed hypersensitivity reactions can vary from 48 to 72 h up to 2128 days . the vascularity and semi - permeability of the oral mucosa allow the easy penetration of the monomer that is leached out of the orthodontic appliance into the underlying tissues and blood vessels which in turn can lead to a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction that may manifest either as contact stomatitis or as lymphadenopathy . the present case did not show any infective , immunologic or neoplastic cause for the lymphadenopathy which was ruled out by doing a series of investigations based on a diagnostic algorithm for the lymphadenopathy . allergic reactions are an established cause for gland enlargement as listed by the who . a study conducted by kamogashira et al . involving the use orthodontic appliances in rats showed submandibular and sublingual gland swelling . however , no human studies are available to corroborate the same till date . causes of submandibular gland enlargement we can deduce from this that the leaching of monomer from the appliance might have caused a delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction which caused the enlargement of the submandibular gland . this paper presents a unique first of its kind situation involving orthodontic therapy causing this unexpected condition . dentists need to be aware of the possibility of lymphadenopathies and salivary gland enlargement occurring in conjunction with orthodontic procedures and undertake preventive methods to avoid such circumstances . in a study done by bural et al . it was established that the effects produced by leaching of the monomer can be minimized by immersion of the appliance for 12 h in boiling water before the final delivery . hence , it is recommended to follow these simple , yet important steps before insertion of dental appliances to avoid the possibility of leaching monomer and subsequent hypersensitivity reactions . delayed - type hypersensitivity can manifest as contact stomatitis or lymphadenopathy or even rarely salivary gland enlargement . materials used in orthodontic appliances may possibly leach over a period of time and can cause delayed hypersensitivity reactions . hence , it is important for dental professionals to be aware of this possibility and follow proper procedures to minimize the leaching of monomers after insertion of the appliance . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed . the authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms . in the form the patient(s ) has / have given his / her / their consent for his / her / their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal . the patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity , but anonymity can not be guaranteed .\",\n",

up for 8 years of two patients who refused surgery . spontaneous correction of the clinical deformity occurred in one and in the other the deformity was unchanged . high success rates have been reported with conservative therapy in patients with promptly diagnosed , stable , and rotatory aad not associated with transverse ligament disruption . the transverse ligament is a primary stabilizing component of the atlantoaxial joint . on lateral radiographs of the cervical spine in flexion and extension , an atlas  dens interval ( i.e. , the distance between the anterior arch of c1 more than 3 mm is considered unstable . however , the choice between conservative therapy and fusion depends on whether or not the lesion is stable . the transverse ligament is intact in patients with bilateral rotator aad but is ruptured in unilateral dislocation . in patients with instability due to transverse ligament disruption , c2c1 fusion by screws is the option associated with the smallest degree of motion range limitation . in chronic aarf , it is essential not to reduce the joint after the transoral release . fang and ong reported a case of chronic aad in which a blunt hook was used to reduce the joint . hemorrhage occurred on several occasions and despite adequate resuscitation , the patient developed a fever and died 9 days after transoral surgery . govender and kumar concluded that although aarf is uncommon , early recognition and treatment may prevent subsequent instability and deformity . mri of the atlantoaxial complex and mra of the vertebral arteries are essential before surgery in patients with chronic aarf . a staged procedure was safe and useful in correcting the clinical and radiological deformity in chronic aarf after trauma . skull traction is indicated , if necessary in association with direct manipulation of the neck . rotatory aad is relatively rare in adults but can be caused by neck injuries ; diagnosis is easily missed if the neurological evaluation is normal . an anteroposterior open - mouth plain radiograph suggests the diagnosis , which can be confirmed by ct . skull traction is indicated , if necessary in association with direct manipulation of the neck . stability is dependent on whether the transverse ligament is intact and can be evaluated by measuring the atlas  dens interval on dynamic cervical radiographs and the atlas  axis angle on ct scans in maximum rotation . when the atlantodental exceeds 5 mm , there is instability of the c1-c2 complex and posterior c1/2 fixation is indicated .',\n",

valve effect , whereby csf enters the cyst with systolic pulsation but disables to exit through the same entrance of the cyst during diastole . congenital arachnoidal defect and valve mechanism of the cyst may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sacral perineurial cyst . a variety of surgical techniques have been described to treat tarlov cyst . in tarlov 's original article , he used either complete or partial excision of the cyst or incision and drainage without excision . since this original article , several authors proposed microsurgical cyst excision , cyst fenestration and imbrications8,11,13,14 ) . more recently , a nonsurgical treatment with percutaneous ct -

       " {'article': 'we report on a case of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction ( dhtr ) occurred 7 days after an erythrocytapheresis or eritroexchange procedure ( eex ) treated with rituximab and glucocorticoids in a 15-years old patient with sickle cell disease . eex was performed despite a previous diagnosis of alloimmunization , in order to reduce hemoglobin s rate before a major surgery for avascular necrosis of the femoral head . however , rituximab could nt prevent dhtr that occurred with acute hemolysis , hemoglobinuria and hyperbilirubinemia . a further dose of rituximab and three boli of methylprednisolone were given after the onset of the reaction . it is likely that the combined use of rituximab and steroids managed to gradually improve both patient s general conditions and hemoglobin levels . nor early or late side effects were registered in a 33-months follow - up period . this report suggests the potential effectiveness and safety of rituximab in combination with steroids in managing and mitigating the symptoms of delayed post - transfusional hemolytic reactions in alloimmunized patients affected by sickle cell disease with absolute need for erythrocytapheresis . the incidence of alloimmunization against red blood cells ( rbc ) antigens has been reported in up to 5 - 36% patients affected by sickle cell disease ( scd ) after at least one transfusion . delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction / hyperhemolysis ( dhtr / h ) syndrome is a complication of alloimmunization , occurring in about 11% of patients with rbc alloantibodies . sometimes , in particularly severe cases , this reaction constitutes a contra - indication to further transfusions . however , the use of eex for the preparation of scd patients to major surgery is suggested in order to reduce the short and medium - term risks and to guarantee a better outcome from surgery itself , even if this indication is nt strictly accepted by all authors and guidelines . rituximab is a well - known anti - cd20 immunosuppressive drug used for the treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemias . the use of rituximab in the treatment of alloimmunization - related hemolysis has been previously reported in some cases . a 15 years old girl came to our clinic with a diagnosis of homozygous scd . prior to this , the patient had been sporadically transfused for episodes of severe anemia in her home country , ghana . at the moment of her arrival in italy , a positive direct coombs test and a negative indirect coombs test were detected . a first diagnosis of alloimmunization was made at the age of 10 years ( in 2004 ) , after repeated acute post - transfusional hemolytic episodes . the result of both direct and indirect coombs tests ( checked again after these events ) was now positive . anti - e and anti - s antibodies were isolated from the patient serum . due to the several complications the girl had developed since her arrival to our clinic , ( of which , one ischemic stroke ) chronic transfusions were strongly recommended . nevertheless , considering the high risk of severe hemolysis contra - indicating transfusions , the girl was treated with hydroxiurea and erythropoietin in order to maintain good hemoglobin levels and good control of pain crises . in 2008 , both direct and indirect coombs test were negative , probably as a consequence of a drop of antibodies titer below detectable levels . due to the presence of progressive ischemic areas in the brain as detected by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the attending physician decided to start a program of periodic eex . the first procedure was apparently well tolerated . however , after 7 days , a severe dhtr / h presented with diffuse pain , worsening of clinical conditions and acute hemolytic anemia ( hb nadir : 4.3 g / dl ) ; the event was efficiently treated with methylprednisolone ( 10 mg / kg / die ) and the eex program was discontinued . in the meantime two years later also the left femoral head was affected by osteonecrosis . at this time she had an harris hip score of 18.55 ( < 70 : poor ) on the right side and of 83.05 on the left side : hbs levels higher than 80% ( representing a high risk for sickling ) in the absence of anemia ( hb about 10 g / dl ) did nt allow clinicians to recommend major surgery without a preventive eex . nevertheless , the high risk for dhtr represented a life threat for the girl during surgery and in the immediate post - operative phase . at this time , the direct coombs test was still negative ( same was the eluate testing ) , while indirect coombs test was now positive and anti - s antibodies were detected in serum . due to the very low titer of these antibodies , plasmapheresis was not taken into consideration . before performing eex , the patient s rbc phenotype was further investigated according to the main red blood cells antigens groups ( mns , duffy , rh , kidd and kell ) in order to select donors with the highest possible compatibility . with regard to the duffy system , the patient was both fy a and fy b negative ; the blood units chosen were fy a negative , in consideration of the higher probability of eliciting immunologic responses with this antigen than with fy b. although anti - e antibodies ( previously isolated in serum ) were nt identified at this further cross - match screening , rbc units selected were also antigen - e negative , in consideration of the likely fall of their titer below detectable levels at the moment of recheck ; if not respected , this anamnestic response could have involved a severe hemolytic reaction . four days before eex which was performed the day before surgery ( under a regimen of close clinical monitoring ) , obtaining hb : 10 g / dl and hbs < 30% ( 5 units of rbc purified from sag - mannitolo were employed ) . blood immunoglobulines ( ig ) and cd20 lymphocytes were normal before the administration of rituximab ; checked about 10 days after the first dose , the absolute concentration of cd20 cells had dropped to 0 elements / ml ( 0% ) , confirming its effectiveness . no clinical problems occurred in the first few days after surgery ( negative hemolysis indexes , no hemoglobinuria , hb : 7.2 g / dl as expected for surgical blood loss in the first day , hb levels stably around 7 g / dl in the next five days ) . seven days after eex , a massive hemolytic crisis occurred ( hb : 4.7 g / dl , total bilirubin : 2.7 mg / dl , ldh : 1191 , severe haemoglobinuria ) . ( 25 mg / kg ) and a rbc transfusion was performed ; the blood unit was completely hemolyzed ( in spite of the best apparent compatibility at crossmatch ) and hyperhemolysis was detected in the following hours ( nadir hb : 3.7 g / dl ; ldh : 3875 mg / dl , total bilirubin : 3.5 mg / dl ) . the patient s clinical conditions and vital signs remained stable . at this stage a second dose of rituximab ( 375 mg / m ) was administered , followed by two further boli of methylprednisolone , while a strong and definite contraindication to further transfusions became mandatory ( except in case of possible circulatory failure ) . hemoglobin level spontaneously reached basal values and the girl was discharged after four weeks ( figure 1 ) . the blood concentration of cd20 lymphocytes was checked six months after discharge and it was normal . the partial difference between cd20 recovery time we ve recorded and the average time described in literature in case of autoimmune haemolytic anemias ( aiha ) , , probably depends on the shorter administration regimen we ve employed : cd20 depletion is described to last up to 9 - 12 months after the administration of 4 weekly doses of rituximab ( 375 mg / m ) in the treatment of aiha . in the present case , only two doses were administered , and it explains the shorter duration of cd20 lymphocytes depletion . currently , hemoglobin levels range between 8.5 g / dl and 9.5 g / dl with the only use of hydroxyurea ( 25 mg / kg / die ) . from the orthopedic point of view good - excellent results were scored in the immediate postoperative time and at 1 year follow - up . no surgical site complication , no rehabilitation problems and no articular limitations appeared . at 1 year follow up the harris hip score reached excellent results ( 95.7 with the following score references : < 70 poor ; 70 - 79 fair ; 80 - 89 good ; > 90 excellent ) . after transfusion , the exposure to alloantigens expressed on donor s rbc may lead recipient s b - lymphocytes to produce specific alloantibodies . patients with scd are frequently subject to repeated transfusions and present higher rates of alloimmunization than other groups treated with multiple transfusions : one of the postulated reasons is that donors and recipients often belong to different ethnical groups . besides , rbc in scd patients often express higher levels of phosphatydilserine , that increases both antibodies and complement fixation . nevertheless , although alloantibodies are easily isolated in serum at the beginning of the process , their concentration often falls below detectable levels throughout time : this is the reason why historical antibodies always have to be taken into consideration and honored in selecting rbc units to transfuse . furthermore , many rare antigens ca nt be detected by cross - matching tests , increasing the risk of alloimmunization . a single exposure to alloantigens subsequent exposures involve b - memory cells , with much more effective and severe responses , such as dhtr . for all these reasons , alloimunized patients should nt be transfused as long as it is possible . however literature suggests the central role of eex in the preparation of scd patients to major surgery in order to reduce intra- and post - operatory risks linked to dehydration and acidosis that might in turn induce rbc sickling . eex immediately before surgery allows the execution even of major surgical procedures in safety , by lowering hbs to values < 30% . alloimmunization and the consequent contraindication to transfusion represents a big issue which has to be faced in these situations . a prophylactic therapy with immunedepressive drugs becomes necessary before eex , in order to prevent dhtr , which is likely to occur . we describe the use of rituximab in achieving this goal in scd . as far as we know rituximab has been used in several cases to treat ongoing hyperhemolysis , , , but in only one scd patient this therapy was reported as effective when administered before eex preventing acute hemolytic complications . the rationale behind the use of rituximab to prevent dhtr is based on a wide experience with this drug in auto - immune anemias . it both prevents the development of auto - reactive antibodies and reduces antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity towards rbc , by binding fc receptor - expressing effector cells . rituximab might have a dual role in preventing dhtr : i ) by reducing alloantibodies production with the same mechanism described for autoantibodies and ii ) by preventing hyperhemolysis . hyperhemolisis is a separate clinical entity occurring together with dhtr as a consequence of the so - called by - stander hemolysis . this involves autologous rbc and explains the drop of hemoglobin below the levels before transfusion . the present report points out the poor reliability of both direct and indirect coombs test in managing a transfusional program in alloimmunized patients . even after a long time from previous transfusions and despite a negative result of these tests , alloantibodies are constantly released in serum but frequently below detectable levels . a single dose of rituximab did nt prove to be sufficient in the prevention of dhtr in our patient : 7 days after eex , a massive and sudden fall in hemoglobin levels occurred ( nadir : 3.7 g / dl ) while hemolytic indexes increased ; vital signs and clinical conditions remained stable and hemoglobinuria was detected . the best therapeutic regimen for the use of rituximab has yet to be established : in the case here presented , a single dose was administered before eex , but probably a second dose , just after the procedure , could have prevented the hemolysis we observed . in fact , in a similar case reported by noizat and pirenne two doses of rituximab ( one administered before surgery and the other a few days later ) avoided hemolysis in a similar situation . anyway , rituximab probably played a central role ( in association with steroid boli ) in rapidly improving patient s general conditions and hemoglobin levels . no clinical trials have demonstrated that the combined administration of rituximab and corticosteroids is more effective than rituximab alone in treating aiha . the partial result we ve achieved may depend both on the association of the first dose of rituximab and three boli of methyprednisolon and on the administration of a second dose of anti - cd20 about 6 days after surgery . it is possible that the administration of a second dose of rituximab immediately after surgery could effectively prevent dhtr also without corticosteroids . considering the high risk of infections in scd patients and in relation to major surgery , this treatment must be used only when the history of dhtr / h is highly significant , strictly monitoring any infective complication . in a patient affected by scd presenting with alloimmunization , a history of severe episodes of dhtr / h and absolute need for eex , rituximab showed to be a safe treatment even in association with boli of methylprednisolone in order to manage and mitigate the symptoms of delayed post - transfusional hemolytic reactions . considering the partial result achieved , we suggest the administration of two doses of rituximab before transfusion , that ( differently from the case here described ) , could even prevent dhtr to occur .',\n",

alcon , fort worth , texas ) . after 0.5% apraclonidine drops in both eyes , the examination was repeated in the 30th and 60th minutes . while explicit mydriasis in the left eye and mild retraction in the upper eyelid were detected , no mydriasis was found in the right eye ( fig .  2 ) . oculosympathetic innervation is a three - neuron pathway starting in the central nervous system and finalizing in the eye . interruption of this innervation causes mild ptosis on the affected upper eyelid , anhidrosis and myosis . while congenital cases may be linked to idiopathic or birth trauma , the tumoral infiltration which is common in the adult period may occur as a result of surgery and trauma . moreover , horner 's syndrome may occur secondary to benign thyroid lesions . in our patient , horner 's syndrome was secondary to the thyroid surgery . because access to the patient 's surgery records was not available , the nature of primary lesion ( malignant versus benign ) was unknown . due to the fact that the patient did not receive any other treatment except surgery and her screening was interrupted , we believe that it was benign . what differentiates this particular case from other iatrogenic horner is the availability of heterochromia just like in congenital cases . to best of our knowledge , few cases were reported to have acquired horner 's syndrome with heterochromia in the literature.4 , 5 , 6 with the exception of diesenhouse 's and byrne 's report,7 , 8 most of these cases were acquired horner 's syndrome which developed in childhood . the researchers investigating congenital horner 's syndrome believe that the interruption of postganglionic pathway caused neurotropic diagenesis in the iris melanocytes . moreover , the melanocytes in the stroma and sympathetic nerve endings were electron - microscopically defined and it was reported that iris hyperpigmentation was due to the melanocyte recruitment from the neural crest . it was reported that as a result of showing heterochromia in adult horner 's syndrome , this particular situation occurred due to the damage to the cells rather than the loss of the cells as a result of denervation . even though horner 's syndrome can be clinically diagnosed , it should be confirmed by some pharmacologic tests in order to be able to differentiate them from the other anisocoria and ptosis causes , especially in adults.10 , 11 while cocaine and apraclonidine are diagnostic in these tests , hydroxyamphetamine test can be used in differentiating pre - post ganglionic cases . apraclonidine , which is alpha adrenergic agonist , finalizes the diagnosis by actualizing the mydriasis in eyes in which horner 's syndrome - related denervation hypersensitivity has developed . since apraclonidine has recently become readily available and is difficult to differentiate with respect to sensitivity and specificity from cocaine , it has been used late more than before.12 , 13 as we only had apraclonidine 0.5% available , we did this test and confirmed our horner 's syndrome diagnosis . in conclusion , the development of horner 's syndrome as a result of neck surgery and especially thyroid surgery has been reported many times in the literature and is a well - known case . the present case shows that iris heterochromia may develop in iatrogenic horner 's syndrome in adults as well .\",\n",

dose acetylsalicylic acid . this report describes a 56-year - old female patient with a pfo who suffered from recurrent strokes despite long - term medication with clopidogrel for sps . in 1997 , the patient was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack ( tia ) with initial right - sided hemihypesthesia followed by discrete , accented brachiofacial hemiparesis . cardiovascular and neurological examinations were unremarkable . the patient was discharged without any residual defects . in december 2007 , the patient was admitted because of acute sensomotoric aphasia as well as a right - sided discrete , distinctive , accented brachiofacial hemiparesis . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain was performed and she was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke . after thrombolytic , occupational , and speech therapy , the patient was discharged without complaints . in view of the suspected allergy to acetylsalicylic acid , a permanent anticoagulant with clopidogrel was prescribed ( 75 mg daily ) . despite the long - term anticoagulant treatment with clopidogrel , the patient was admitted again in december 2008 with global aphasia . while exercising , she suddenly felt nauseated and dizzy , and had speech difficulty . during admittance , the patient was well oriented and cardiopulmonary stable , however , not able to communicate verbally or in writing . immediate investigations revealed an ischemic cerebrovascular accident in the area of the media cerebral arterial distribution . a systemic thrombolytic therapy was prescribed which resulted in regression of symptoms . however , during this admission , transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a pfo . the patient recovered without any residual defects and was discharged in a fortnight with continued rehabilitative therapy . three months later , the anticoagulation regime was changed from clopidogrel to subcutaneous heparin and a series of hypercoagulability studies was performed . as a result , the anticoagulant treatment was adjusted to include low - dose acetylsalicylic acid ( 100 mg / day ) . the analysis at 1 month demonstrated a therapeutic effect of the low - dose acetylsalicylic acid medication . in addition , the closure of the pfo was performed under transesophageal echocardiography control at a specialised center in april 2009 . after percutaneous closure , the patient received clopidogrel ( 75 mg / day for 6 months ) additionally . an intact atrial septum with a correct positioning of the implanted device was seen in the 18-month follow up . she has since had thrombotic events , is free of pain , and able to do well in activities of daily living . patient 's children were also evaluated for hypercoagulable states , although neither reported a previous thrombotic event . the cause of stroke remains unknown in roughly one - third of patients , despite extensive investigation . the presence of a pfo , a remnant of the fetal circulation that is present in approximately 25% of the general population , has been linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke , especially in cases without an alternative explanation ( cryptogenic strokes).[35 ] and it is well known that recurrent thromboembolic events are more frequent in patients who have had a pfo associated with paradoxical embolism . otherwise , inherited hypercoagulable states like deficiencies of specific coagulation inhibitors or platelet hyperactivity can also result in thromboembolic events . sps appears to be transmitted with an autosomal pattern and about two - thirds of the affected patients have a positive family history of thromboembolic disease . it has been noted in previous studies that an increased sympathetic activity associated with emotional stress results in a higher level of epinephrine , which is accompanied by an increased platelet reactivity with unexplained arterial and/or venous thrombotic events . sps was identified as a cause of thromboembolic kidney graft infarction , arterial microemboli in the fingers , peripheral arterial occlusion , and stroke . treatment of sps is acetylsalicylic acid medication , as it inhibits platelet aggregation and prevents recurrent thromboses . in our case , the etiology of patient 's neurological events is more than difficult to explain . a second possibility , which might be especially important in our case , is the combination of sps and pfo which further increases the recurrent strokes than either etiology alone . due to this however , to date , there is a considerable uncertainty about the optimal management of patients with pfo and stroke , with treatment strategies including systemic anticoagulation , open - heart surgery,[1618 ] and transcatheter pfo closure having been proposed to reduce the risk of recurrent events . the patient was informed of the options of treatment , and she decided to undergo percutaneous closure . we are convinced that the decision in this case was correct and safe , because the percutaneous closure of pfo is a safe procedure associated with a high success rate and a low incidence of periprocedural complications and recurrences of thromboembolic events . we believe that sps is a frequent disease predisposing to vascular events but often remains undiagnosed as long as no second insult to the coagulation system or vasculature occurs . in this case report , the third cerebrovascular accident in combination with the diagnosis of a pfo led to extended investigations of the hemostatic system . one should keep in mind that the therapy with warfarin , if the sps were responsible for the recurrent strokes , was not adequate to prevent further vascular complications . this case report highlights the importance of thorough investigations of the hemostatics system of patients who experience thrombotic events , especially under anticoagulation therapy . as demonstrated in this report , the combination of hemostatitic abnormality and a pfo is unique in the current stroke literature .\",\n",

( h&e staining ; x100 ) ( a ) ; ( x400 ) ( b )  huge aggregations of amyloid material and very small foci of calcification were also observed . panoramic view taken from the present illness showed an ill - defined radiolucency in the same area . on computed tomography scan , a massive intraosseous lesion was disclosed in the left maxilla involving the orbit and ethmoidal air cells superiorly and the nasal airway medially ( figure 2 ) . incisional biopsy and histopathological examination verified the clinical diagnosis of ceot ( pindborg tumor ) , which confirmed the recurrence of the previous tumor ( figure 3 ) . the microscopic findings of the incised lesion were similar to the primary one , in which amyloid aggregation was remarkable . conventional epithelial cell features of ceot , including polyhedral cells with mild pleomorphism and prominent intercellular bridges were also evident . the only apparent distinction was the presence of more foci of calcification in the recurrent lesion . axial ( a ) and coronal ( b ) computed tomography scan sections showing extension of the tumor to the left maxillary sinus and destruction of adjacent tissues . microscopic evaluation shows nests and strands of large polyhedral epithelial cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism . also , variable sized sheets of amyloid and small irregular foci of calcification are observed .

old nulliparous caucasian woman presented to our emergency department reporting abdominal colicky pain and distension in the last 24 hours , with nausea and vomiting . she reported a long - standing history of constipation and several episodes of abdominal pain during the last 2 years for some of which she had visited a hospital , but no other diagnosis except that of irritable bowel syndrome was made . the rest of her medical history was insignificant , apart from gastritis for which she had a prescription of omeprazole . she had no operations in the past , and she admitted to smoking and occasional alcohol use . a paternal aunt had died of breast cancer , and a paternal cousin had colon cancer . her vital signs included a rectal temperature of 36.8 c , a blood pressure of 115/75 mm hg , and a heart rate of 95 pulses per minute . she was in mild distress , and a physical examination revealed abdominal distension with diffuse tenderness . on the auscultation of the abdomen , laboratory data revealed an elevation in the white blood cell count to 19200/mm , with 80% neutrophils . the result was an image of small - bowel obstruction with air - fluid levels ( figure 1 ) . based on that evidence a nasogastric tube was inserted , and the patient was placed under a prophylactic regimen of antibiotics . her clinical condition did not improve in the next 24 hours , despite the fact that she had 2 fleet enemas , and her second abdominal radiograph showed that the loops of ileus were still present and the bowel sounds were still hypoactive . a phlegmon in the right flank was discovered , which involved the terminal ileus , the cecum , the appendix , and the right fallopian tube . a cyst of dark brown ( chocolate ) color could be seen on top of the mass , but the cecum and the appendix could not be visualized . we performed adhesiolysis with the use of ultrasound scissors , but despite extensive attempts to mobilize the terminal ileum , the cecum and the appendix remained inaccessible . given these difficulties along with the peril of perforation of the small bowel , we decided to proceed to an open laparotomy with a subumbilical mid - line incision . under direct observation , we identified the intussusception of the distal ileum through the ileocecal valve and into the cecum . the appendix was found in the retrocecal region . with the use of the ultrasound scissors , we managed to free the right fallopian tube , and we decided to excise the right colon with the cecum , appendix , and terminal ileum en block . an end - to - end anastomosis was performed in 2 layers of absorbable stitches . two days after the operation , the patient passed gas , and the day after she passed stool . plain abdominal radiograph showing air - fluid levels and the absence of gas throughout the colon . the histological examination macroscopically showed a parietal tumor at the terminal ileum with a diameter > 3 cm . the microscopic image showed that this was a tumor composed of endometriosis ( figure 2 ) . the patient , after the results of the histological examination , was advised to seek a gynecologist for the identification and treatment of any residual foci of endometriosis . adult intussusception is a rare condition , and it is agreed that a general surgeon may encounter only a few cases in his career . begos et al in their review of 1048 cases considered that 1 or 2 cases of adult intussusception occur in each institution every year . there is no sex predilection , and the median age of presentation is in the sixth to seventh decade of life . as the mechanism is concerned , it is believed that an identifiable lesion within the bowel 's lumen interferes with its peristaltic activity . subsequent peristalsis of the bowel produces an area of constriction above the stimulus and relaxation below , thus telescoping the lead point ( intussusceptum ) through the distal intestinal part ( intussuscipiens ) . the intussusceptum is propelled onwards by peristalsis with mesentery and vessels becoming involved leading to the impediment of venous flow and afterwards of arterial supply . according to its location lastly , an intussusception is characterized as ileocecal when the lead point is found on the ileocecal valve . clinical presentation of intussusception varies , and the symptoms are wide ranging and often nonspecific . fewer than 20% of cases present acutely with complete bowel obstruction , and usually the presentation is either subacute or chronic , consistent with partial obstruction . our patient developed acute symptoms , although she reported many episodes of abdominal pain the preceding 2 years . the classic triad consisting of abdominal pain , palpable mass , and heme - positive stools is rarely present . the most common presenting symptoms are intermittent abdominal pain ( 75% to 78% ) , nausea and vomiting ( 68% to 78% ) , and physical examination may reveal abdominal tenderness ( 60% ) , distention ( 45% ) , and an abdominal mass ( 7% to 50% ) . azar et al reported that patients with benign enteric lesions tend to more frequently experience abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting , whereas patients with colonic lesions present more often with melena or guaiac stool . table 1 summarizes the findings of the biggest series concerning the location of intussusception and its cause . of 1206 cases of adult intussusception , 35% were colonic and 65% involved the small intestine . of the 780 small bowel intussusceptions , 482 ( 62% ) were due to a benign lesion , whereas a malignant lesion was found in 18% of cases . in contrast , large bowel intussusceptions were attributed to a benign lesion in 30% of cases , and malignant lesions caused 245 ( 58% ) cases . this is consistent with the fact that malignancy is much more common in the large bowel . in addition , it is evident that an underlying cause was present in nearly 83% of cases of adult intussusception . literature review of 1206 cases of adult intussusception ( location and cause ) a wide range of underlying lesions causing intussusception has been reported , but there is only one case of endometriosis of the small bowel resulting in intussusception . endometriosis is a common entity , affecting around 15% of childbearing women and was first described by von rokitansky in 1860 . various theories have been proposed to explain its development , and the most widely accepted is that of retrograde migration of endometrial tissue from the uterus to fallopian tubes and then to the peritoneal cavity . two reviews comprising almost 7200 cases of endometriosis each showed that small - bowel involvement has a frequency of less than 1% . the complications of intestinal endometriosis include intestinal obstruction , perforation , hemorrhagic ascites , protein - losing enteropathy , anasarca , and intussusception , which is mainly related to the vermiform appendix . protein ca-125 is generally found elevated in endometriosis , as was the case in our patient . nonetheless , its diagnostic accuracy has been shown to be limited in several series ( sensitivity 24% to 94% , specificity 83% to 93% ) . in our patient , the inflammation , fibrosis , and hyperplasia of the intestinal smooth muscle led to the formation of adhesions . this has been described in other cases , the proposed mechanism being an endometrioma that responds to hormonal influence . preoperative diagnosis of adult intussusception is difficult to establish , varying from 32% to 51% . the absence of a pathognomic clinical manifestation leaves the burden of diagnosis to radiologic methods . plain radiographs show intestinal obstruction and may indicate the site of obstruction , but they lack sensitivity and false - negative results may occur . contrast studies like barium enema or upper gastrointestinal series can locate the intussusception , giving a  coiled spring  because of the perforation risk and common false - positive results , it is not routinely recommended . abdominal ultrasound is useful , but the presence of air in the intestine can always give false - negative results . lim et al and sofia et al using sonography managed to diagnose 11 and 3 cases , respectively , of adult intussusception . computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) are the diagnostic methods of choice for evaluating adult intussusception , its leading point , and possible associated pathology . the  target sign  and the sausage - shaped appearance are 2 typical images seen on ct . in addition , the appearance of bowel - within - bowel configuration with or without mesenteric fat and vessels compressed between the walls of small bowel is considered pathognomonic . magnetic resonance with ultrafast multiplanar techniques permits adequate and rapid assessment , especially of cases of small - bowel obstructions . colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy has also been used in cases of large - bowel lesions to not only diagnose but also to correct intussusception . the treatment of intussusception caused by ileal endometriosis consists of surgical resection of the affected intestinal part with termino - terminal anastomosis , which is often done on an emergency basis , as was the case with our patient . the associated risks are ( a ) intraluminal seeding or venous embolization in regions of ulcerated mucosa , ( b ) possible perforation during manipulation , and ( c ) subjecting the patient to increased risk of anastomotic complications in the setting of edematous or weakened bowel . it is generally agreed that reduction should not be attempted when signs are present of ischemia or inflammation . also it should never be attempted in the large bowel because of the aforementioned high frequency of malignancy . regarding the small bowel , some authors advocate the principle of resection without reduction except for cases where there is a danger of short - gut syndrome . in recent series , a selective approach without bowel resection the age of the patient , radiologic findings , and the location of the intussusception must always be taken into account . furthermore , in some cases , such as meckel 's diverticulum , benign polyps , peutz - jeghers syndrome , adhesions , terminal ileitis , and postoperative and posttraumatic intussusception , when no other cause can be found in the bowel , resection may not be needed . the experience of the surgeon and his ability to determine the possibility of a malignancy should be the determining factor when reduction is contemplated . intussusception is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in adults , and endometriosis as its underlying lesion is even more uncommon . it is important to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion taking into account the nonspecific clinical presentation and the findings of radiologic studies to establish the correct diagnosis and proceed without delay to the resection of the intussuscepted bowel .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'anterior dislocation of the shoulder is a common injury , which is often reduced in the emergency department without the need for specialist orthopedic input . in cases where anterior shoulder dislocations can not be reduced in the emergency department , a successful closed reduction can usually be performed under general anesthetic . in the rare instances where this fails , open surgical reduction may be required . these include : interposition of the long head of biceps tendon or subscapularis tendon ; impaction of the humeral head on glenoid labrum and dislocated bony fragments from the glenoid or greater tuberosity . we describe a case of an irreducible locked primary anterior glenohumeral dislocation with impaction of the humeral head onto the antero - inferior glenoid rim with subsequent generation of a hill  however , a locked irreducible impacted humerus is rare and has only been reported on an individual basis . we utilized a novel closed reduction technique using computed tompography ( ct ) to assist in generating a sequence of movements to disimpact the shoulder . thus , it avoids further iatrogenic injuries and operative surgery , which is the traditional course of action in this situation and has associated complications and morbidity . a 57-year - old gentleman , volunteer community driver , with a history of ethanol abuse , presented to the emergency department 2 days following a mechanical fall , with left shoulder pain and reduced function . he slipped on the pavement , fell backward , outstretching his left arm to break the fall , sustaining an isolated injury to the left shoulder . the only significant past medical history was recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli for which he takes long - term oral anticoagulation ( warfarin ) . on clinical examination , the patient had reduced range of motion and there was no neurovascular deficit in the left upper limb . based on the plain radiographs [ figure 1 ] , the patient underwent two unsuccessful left shoulder manipulations under sedation in the emergency department . subsequently , manipulation under general anesthetic was performed the following day by the orthopedic team and was similarly unsuccessful . at this point operative intervention was considered , but given the long - term warfarin use and history of chronic alcohol abuse , it was felt on balance the case should be managed non - surgically , if at all possible . plain radiographs , ap and axillary views identifying humeral head lying inferior to the glenoid cavity . radiologist initially suspected a fracture of the glenoid labrum , a bankart lesion ct of the left shoulder was performed , which identified a 2-cm , > 20% hill  there were small bony fragments around inferior glenoid ; these little flecks of bone might have been produced during attempted reduction under anesthesia . after review of the image , it was appreciated that an incorrect reduction may cause further soft tissue injury or humeral fractures . following this , the patient underwent a second manipulation under anesthetic ; the arm was externally rotated by 40 with the arm in extension , after which direct lateral traction was applied and the shoulder was successfully disimpacted and reduced without causing any iatrogenic injury . patient was discharged with a shoulder immobilizer for 4 weeks and sling thereafter for 2 weeks with physiotherapy . patient suffered initial stiffness due to immobilization , but was responding well to physiotherapy with good rotations and range of motion . at 6-month follow - up he has returned to work as a driver and reports no functional deficit in comparison to pre - operative levels or effect on the quality of life . on examination , the patient can abduct to 140 , has forward flexion to 170 and normal rotations . assisted computer tomography with three - dimensional reconstruction showing an anterior sub - coracoid dislocated left shoulder with humeral head impacted on antero - inferior rim of glenoid failure to reduce an acute anterior shoulder dislocation is rare , particulalry following manipulation under anesthesia . open reduction is the traditional course of management in this scenario , with intraopertive findings frequently reporting interposition of a structure into the joint . an avulsion fracture of the greater tuberosity , for instance , occurs in 1012% of anterior dislocations . irrespective of a high incidence of bankart lesions and hill  sachs lesions , most acute primary dislocations are successfully managed in the emergency department . each report identifies the structure mechanically obstructing reduction , such as a displaced glenoid labrum , interposition of the tendon of the long head of biceps , a bony fragment from the glenoid and a fragment of the greater tuberosity . most importantly , all the patients in previous reports went on to open reduction , exposing the patient to a surgical procedure and its associated morbidity , and producing reduced range of motion , particularly external rotation . arthroscopic surgery does not sacrifice the subscapularis with better functional outcomes ; it can also be performed as an outpatient . however , it has a higher re - dislocation rate and open procedure remains the gold standard . a summary of case reports published between 1966 and 2008 , with individual causes for irreducible anterior dislocation the dislocations reported by guha et al . , the glenohumeral joint failed to reduce due to an impacted humeral head on the glenoid rim , with subsequent hill  lam and kuhnen et al . performed putti platt procedures , where the subscapularis tendon is divided and re - attached , stabilizing the joint but reducing external rotation . postoperatively , the authors report good stability with satisfactory long - term functional outcome , whilst not commenting on any complications . intraoperative disruption to the rotator cuff has a detrimental effect on recovery , stiffness and range of movement . our patient benefited from high - resolution ct imaging and 3d reconstruction , modifying closed reduction techniques and preventing open surgery . this is beneficial to a patient on long - term anticoagulation for recurrent deep vein thrombosis and alcohol dependence . the enhanced ct views obtained identified the need for lateral traction to disimpact the head , not apparent on mobile fluoroscopy during the initial reduction attempts . plain radiographs diagnosed dislocation of the glenohumeral joint , with stryker notch views identifying hill  however , detecting an impacted humerus is difficult on plain radiographs , with ct having greater sensitivity and identifying soft tissue components . traditionally , ct and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) are used post reduction to assess stability in cases of recurrent dislocation . ct scanning is more accessible , less expensive and provides reproducible outcomes when assessing bony and soft tissue injury . three - dimensional techniques provide an accurate analysis of the location and extent of injury . table 1 summarizes the mechanical obstacles to reduction , where soft tissue causes predominate . additionally , a case described in 2010 utilized ct imaging to identify the long head of biceps tendon causing obstructing reduction . the authors support ct and mri as a useful adjunct to conventional radiography , allowing identification of soft tissue obstacles to reduction with good sensitivity . state that downward traction , rotation and abduction during manipulative reduction endangers neurovascular structures . hill  sachs lesions are often clinically insignificant ; however , humeral head impaction can result in more significant fractures through humeral neck during reduction . axillary artery transection , where the elderly are more susceptible , after shoulder dislocation is rare . recurrent dislocation , particularly in the young , causes significant morbidity after acute injury . in short - term follow - up , our patient did not report any neurovascular deficit and no further dislocations . initial stiffness and reduced range of motion due to immobilization improved with physiotherapy , as expected . we are keen to follow him up to see if he develops instability and requires intervention for the large hill  three months following surgery , the patient was able to abduct to 60 with functional rotations . interestingly , the humeral head defect interfered with extremes of abduction ; however , the patient refused a hemiarthroplasty . it can be seen in literature reports that primary anterior dislocation in patients aged less than 40 is invariably associated with glenoid labrum disruption and instability . reduction technique is often decided on an individual patient basis , with pain relief , patient anxiety , operator preference , and resource allocation influencing the choice of the method . repeated forceful manipulation may have increased risk of fracture and neurovascular injury . to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of an acute primary traumatic irreducible anterior shoulder dislocation being successfully manipulated under anesthesia , without surgery , due to enhanced images obtained through ct identifying a hill  \\n an irreducible anterior glenohumeral dislocation with an impacted humeral head is rare . the long head of biceps tendon , subscapularis muscle and glenoid labrum lesions may also obstruct shoulder reduction.anterior shoulder dislocations that do not reduce should not undergo repeated manipulation to avoid iatrogenic neurovascular injury and fractures.failure to reduce anterior glenohumeral dislocations should prompt ct imaging to define injury and cause of obstruction to reduction , prior to further manipulation or operative intervention.ct imaging defines the manipulative maneuvers required to disimpact and reduce the shoulder without resorting to open surgical techniques thus avoiding its associated morbidities.ct imaging is sensitive and accessible . additional information on soft - tissue and bony deficits , identifying potential instability , assists long - term treatment plans . \\n  an irreducible anterior glenohumeral dislocation with an impacted humeral head is rare . the long head of biceps tendon , subscapularis muscle and glenoid labrum lesions may also obstruct shoulder reduction . anterior shoulder dislocations that do not reduce should not undergo repeated manipulation to avoid iatrogenic neurovascular injury and fractures . failure to reduce anterior glenohumeral dislocations should prompt ct imaging to define injury and cause of obstruction to reduction , prior to further manipulation or operative intervention . ct imaging defines the manipulative maneuvers required to disimpact and reduce the shoulder without resorting to open surgical techniques thus avoiding its associated morbidities . additional information on soft - tissue and bony deficits , identifying potential instability , assists long - term treatment plans .',\n",

       " {'article': \"a 74-year - old male presented unconscious to a small community hospital in florid shock . following prompt intubation and initial hemodynamic stabilization the patient was transferred to our cardiac intensive care unit for a presumed devastating cardiac event . on arrival the patient was found to be in extremis with his initial objective presentation listed in table 1 . a history was obtained from the patient 's wife who stated that the patient was in his usual state of health until two weeks prior when his reactive airway disease began to worsen with the progression of winter . for the past 67 years the patient had been taking karo syrup with ephedrine ( forcalide syrup ) every day to treat his reactive airway disease . the patient had carried the diagnosis of reactive airway disease following the accidental ingestion of gasoline at age 7 . since that time his local pharmacist has prepared the karol - ephedrine syrup , which the patient later described had  when the patient 's symptoms began to worsen two weeks prior to his admission , he doubled his daily intake of the karol - ephedrine syrup . during the first week his respiratory system improved and the patient was able to return to his usual daily activities . however , during the second week , one week prior to admission , he began experiencing a dull epigastric pain that progressed to periodic bouts of extreme pain . the patient 's pain was associated with fever and anorexia , however , he continued to consume the double dose of karol - ephedrine syrup . on the morning of presentation the patient 's wife found him disoriented , febrile , and experiencing constant extreme abdominal pain . after initial evaluation by our cardiac critical care colleagues , the diagnosis of septic shock was made with suspicion of an abdominal source . a stat portable chest and abdominal radiograph demonstrated a massively dilated stomach with decompressed loops of small bowel ( fig . a nasogastric tube was placed , which immediately released a rush of air and 200 ml of blood - stained bilious fluid . the patient was emergently taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy . upon initial abdominal exploration , more than 3 liters of transudative ascites was evacuated which revealed the obvious cause of the patient 's sepsis and acute abdomen . the stomach was decompressed due to the placement of a nasograstic tube preoperatively , but showed extensive necrosis extending along the greater curvature and dependent portion of the body of the stomach ( fig . close inspection of the stomach revealed multiple microperforations along the greater curvature where the necrosis was most severe . interestingly , palpable pulses were present in the vessels supplying the greater curvature of the stomach and there was no evidence of visceral vascular occlusive disease . with the extent of gastric insult a subtotal gastrectomy was required and his intestinal continuity was restored with a roux - en - y cardiojejunostomy . he discontinued his use of the karol - ephedrine syrup and did not have complications associated with gastrointestinal ischemia anymore . along with a more extensive history , as detailed above , we obtained a sample of the patient 's karol - ephedrine syrup and tested the liquid along with the patient 's serum for the presence of illegal substances and the presence of ephedrine ( table 2 ) . the sample of the syrup was submitted for gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( gc / ms ) screening . a 2.0 ml sample of the karol - ephedrine syrup was combined with 100 l of an internal standard solution ( 0.2 mg / ml benzocaine and 0.2 mg / ml cyheptamide ) , acidified with 1 ml buffer ( ph 4.0 ) and extracted into 6 ml ethyl acetate / chloroform ( 20:80 v / v ) . extracts were dried under 30c nitrogen and reconstituted in 100 l of pyridine / hexane ( 10:90 ) . using an agilent 5973/6890 gc / ms , 1 l of reconstituted sample was injected onto a db-5ms column and subjected to gas chromatographic separation . drugs present were identified by chromatographic retention time compared against a mixture of drug standards , and by structural analysis provided by mass spectrometry . of the tested substances known to cause vasoconstriction or gastric mucosal injury , ephedrine was the only substance that was found to be present in the patient 's karol - ephedrine syrup and his serum . hematoxylin and eosin staining of the gastrectomy specimen demonstrated the presence of chronic gastritis , microvascular thrombosis with full thickness necrosis , and multiple gastric perforations . ephedra is an alkaloid chemical compound obtained from the ephedra sinica plant . in traditional chinese medicine this plant has been used for millennia to treat disorders such as asthma , upper respiratory illnesses and seasonal allergies . in recent years ephedra has gained tremendous popularity as a diet drug because of its biochemical activity as a stimulant and a prothermogenic agent . the stimulant activity of ephedra suppresses appetite while the prothermogenic property increases the body 's metabolism , all leading to improved weight loss . however , over the past decade a number of well - documented reports of ischemic stroke and adverse cardiac events linked to ephedra have lead to a fda ban of the drug in april 2004 as a dietary supplement [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . ephedra causes a number of physiologic effects in addition to suppressing appetite and increasing metabolism [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 12 ] . ephedra causes an increase in blood pressure , heart rate and bronchial dilation [ 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . the effect of ephedra on the vasculature is also well documented and comes from the drugs ability to function as a vasoconstrictor [ 8 , 12 , 13 ] . this effect as a potent vasoconstrictor has lead to the above listed cardiac and cerebral blood flow complications . however , to date no study or case report has shown ephedra to cause microvascular thrombosis and intestinal necrosis . ethanol , aspirin and other vasoactive compounds have been implicated in inducing isolated microvascular ischemia in the stomach . ethanol is thought to induce gastric ischemia by stimulating the release of endothelin-1 , which is a potent vasoconstrictor . aspirin has been shown to reduce local blood flow , leading to microvascular ischemia and gastric mucosal injury [ 14 , 15 , 19 , 20 ] . we conclude that the ephedra in the patient 's forcalide syrup lead to severe vascoconstriction with resultant microvascular thrombosis and gastric necrosis . since this case the physicians and the pharmacy have discontinued prescribing or dispensing forcalide syrup . this is the first case report implicating ephedra as the cause of gastrointestinal ischemia and gastric perforation . we strongly recommend that this albeit rare scenario be added as a warning to the list of potential adverse reactions seen with the ingestion of ephedrine .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'midline cleft of mandible , classified as tessier 30 clefts is extremely rare , with less than 100 reported cases in the latest studies . in this report , we present the first documented iranian case of tessier 30 with median cleft of lower lip and bifid tongue concomitant with congenital heart defects . we explain embryologic origin , differential diagnosis , other associated anomalies and its treatment by reviewing literature . midline clefts of mandible and lower lip are very rare among congenital facial deformities . until now , only 100 cases of this deformity have been reported . couronne described it for the first time in 1819 ( 1 ) . in 1976 , tessier introduced a classification for craniofacial deformity , which consisted of 30 variants . the severity of the cleft can vary from mild notching of the lower lip or mandibular alveolus to complete mandibular , lower lip , and tongue cleavage , which extends to neck structures ( 1 ) . different malformations in other organs such as heart , limbs , and internal organs are also reported concomitant with tessier 30 ( 3 , 4 ) . because of the rarity of tessier 30 syndrome , its variation in presentation and significant association with potentially fatal anomalies , reporting new cases of this condition is still valuable . in this case report , we present the first iranian neonate born with midline cleft of the mandible , tongue , and lower lip classified as tessier 30 concomitant with congenital heart defects . in 2013 , a 12-hour - old iranian boy was referred to taleghani pediatrics hospital in gorgan , iran . he was born via natural vaginal delivery at full term to a 41-year - old mother . his weight and height were 2700 g and 50 cm , respectively . there was no history of any illness or taking any medications during mother s pregnancy . a complete median cleft of mandible , lower lip and tongue with ankyloglossia was apparent in the physical examination . each segment of the mandible was movable and the tongue was stuck to the cleft of the lower lip . an inferoposterior groove was also present in the midline of the tongue ( figure 1 ) . there were no other findings or apparent deformities in the skull , neck , chest , abdomen , genitalia , internal organs , or extremities . during the hospitalization period , the patient was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and received supportive care as the diagnostic workup began . requested laboratory tests transthoracic echocardiography showed a large ventricular septal defect , a mild atrial septal defect and a small patent ductus arteriosus . because of the instability of his general condition and low weight gain during hospitalization , any surgical operation was impossible . finally because of the severity of his congenital cardiac anomalies , the patient expired 12 days after admission . median cleft of lower lip and mandible is a rare congenital anomaly . in some cases , the cleft of lip and mandible is accompanied by the cleft of tongue that varies from bifid anterior tip with ankyloglossia to the bony cleft margins , to marked lingual hypoplasia ( 5 ) . in our case , the midline cleft involved mandible and lower lip , and the tongue was bifid with a deep anteroposterior groove . some reported anomalies associated with tessier syndrome include congenital heart defects ( 1 ) , limb deformities ( 4 ) , absence of the hyoid bone and neck contracture ( 6 ) , sternal cleft , foregut duplication cysts ( 7 ) , and anomalies in soft tissue structures in the neck such as the hyoid bone , thyroid cartilage , and strap muscles of the anterior neck derived from the lower brachial arch ( 8) . in 2013 , adetayo reported a 37-week - old infant with a tessier 30 cleft concomitant with levocardia , a perimembranous moderate - to - large ventricular septal defect , a patent foramen ovale , double outlet right ventricle , intestinal malrotation , and bilateral undescended testicles ( 3 ) . in 2001 , son also presented a case with median cleft of lower lip and mandible concomitant with double inlet single ventricle ( 9 ) . in our case , concurrence of ventricular and atrial septal defects and small patent ductus arteriosus was observed along with the facial anomaly . mandibular clefts may be the result of a failure in merging mandibular prominence within the first branchial arch , separated by a groove in the midline or because of the failure of mesordermal cell migration and penetration . furthermore , the presence of growth centers in the developing mandible is essential for bone formation . partial or complete defects of growth center differentiation may be associated with mandibular defects ( 1 ) . midline cleft of the mandible and lower lip could be one of the rare association of other syndromes such as robinow syndrome , which presents with malformations in extremities , genitalia , vertebrae , and ribs ( 10 ) or richieri - costa syndrome , which involves limb defects , and could be concomitant with mandibular and lower lip cleft ( 11 ) . in our case , there were no other malformations . the prenatal diagnosis of tessier number 30 malformation via ultrasonography at 17 weeks of pregnancy period was reported by kavak in 2014 ( 12 ) . according to maternal age of presented case , we recommend obstetricians consider ultrasound examinations for detecting these anomalies in old maternal age pregnancies . the technique for treating this anomaly does not have many variations ; previous reports suggested release of the tongue in the early stage of life and repair of the other soft tissues , including bifid tongue and lower lip via z - plasty . there is a controversy over the ideal age for mandibular cleft treatment , but many studies suggest the age range of 6 to 12 years old , to prevent damage of the tooth buds during mandible construction . mandibular defect construction involves repairing defect using grafts obtained from ribs , calvarium , or iliac crest , and fixing the graft in its position using wire , screw , or miniplates ( 5 , 13 ) . in summary , we have presented a case of tessier 30 concomitant with heart defects . based on the previous reported cases , this anomaly is curable and can be repaired by surgical reconstruction . in our case , the severity of associated anomalies worsened the neonate s prognosis and physicians lost the opportunity to administer life - saving interventions . thus , these cases should be initially assessed for more severe and fatal concomitant anomalies . in addition , by using new advances in prenatal diagnosis physicians have the chance to decrease complications and plan for appropriate actions .',\n",

related complications necessitating introduction of mycophenolate mofetil for steroid - sparing effect . most ( 70% ) of the patients of igg4-rd and in patients with tin to the order of 90% have elevated plasma levels of igg4 . the histological features consistent with igg4-rd are dense lymphocytoplasmacytic tissue infiltrates , storiform fibrosis , obliterative phlebitis and less frequently mild tissue infiltrates . histological features may differ between different organs , and phlebitis is uncommon on renal biopsy in igg4-related tin . immunohistochemical staining to confirm the presence of igg4 stained plasma cells is essential for the diagnosis of igg4-rd , but the mere detection of these cells is not diagnostic of igg4-rd . the histochemical diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of igg4-related tin are ( 1 ) number of igg4 + cells of > 10/hpf and ( 2 ) the igg4+/igg+ ratio of > 40% . our patient had elevated plasma concentration of igg4 and fulfilled histological and histochemical criteria for igg4-related tin . it is possible that igg4-related tin is underdiagnosed in our country due to the lack of available facilities for histochemical staining . one , the vast majority of patients with igg4-related tin are older than 50 years of age and our patient was younger , at 42 years . two , our case appeared to have isolated renal involvement in this generally multisystem disorder . he did not have lymphadenopathy , features to suggest involvement of pancreas , salivary glands , retroperitoneum in the form of fibrosis , lymph nodes or orbital involvement . however , we could not definitively exclude the subtle involvement of other organs as we did not perform contrast - enhanced computer tomography ( ct ) due to significant azotemia . isolated renal involvement has been reported previously , which could be forme fruste presentation in the evolution of this disease over time . three , he had neither peripheral eosinophilia ( seen in about 40% ) or nephromegaly ( by ultrasonography but ct scan documentation of nephromegaly was not done ) , which could suggest advanced stage of the disease or hyperechoic areas in the kidney on imaging , which are common findings in igg4-related tin . four , steroid therapy is associated with significant improvement in the recovery of renal function and the effect is seen even when much fibrosis is evident on histology . however , delayed therapy may have less favorable impact on the outcome . our patient appears to have presented late in the course and it may be a reason for the partial improvement in renal function . tin in igg4-rd is uncommon and often unrecognized due to lack of availability of histochemical staining and lack of awareness of this disease among clinicians . early diagnosis and steroid therapy are critical for a favorable outcome and delay in diagnosis as seen in our case may result in incomplete recovery .',\n",

old young male developed acute myocardial injury after heroin inhalation and binge drinking while he had no other conventional cardiovascular risk factors . the cause might be heroin - induced cardio toxic effect or vasospasm compounded by the presence of binge drinking .',\n",

       " {'article': 'the resurgence of syphilis in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection in the past decades increased the incidence of this tertiary form of the disease . however , in immunocompetent patients neurosyphilis remains uncommon and accurate diagnosis is challenging as the clinical presentation is unspecific and the validity of supportive laboratory tests is unclear . we describe the case of a 60-year - old man who presented with a 6-month clinical picture of depression - like symptoms and recent sudden unilateral blindness . the investigation led to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with optical involvement in a patient who did not present with any signs of secondary syphilis . treatment with penicillin g and topical steroids resulted in significant clinical improvement and resolution of the visual loss . in the well - established natural history of syphilis , primary syphilis is almost always followed by manifestation of the secondary form , which in turn precedes a period of latency . this case emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion of neurosyphilis in an immunocompetent patient with nonspecific neuropsychiatric manifestations and an atypical course of syphilis infection . antibiotic treatment has reduced the incidence of syphilis over the past decades to the extent that it is now considered a rare condition , thus occasionally misdiagnosed.1 importantly , the widespread use of antibiotics led to changes in its classic clinical presentation . in addition , the validity of diagnostic laboratory tests is unclear.2 epidemiological data indicate a reemergence of the disease in the last two decades in europe and the usa . in 1999 , the world health organization estimated that nearly 12 million new cases of syphilis occurred among adults worldwide.3,4 demographic and socioeconomic shifts such as rising migration from high - prevalence countries and increases in prostitution , men who have sex with men , promiscuity , and underprivilege have been proposed as key factors in the reappearance of the disease.1,58 importantly , it has reemerged concurrently with the global epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection . nevertheless , syphilis remains underestimated and under - recognized due to the variability of clinical presentation and aging of the population with chronic comorbidities . hence some manifestations of the past are nowadays superimposed on the course of chronic diseases.9 the evolution of syphilis is classically divided into three symptomatic stages ( primary , secondary , and tertiary ) and two asymptomatic stages ( early and late latent ) . primary syphilis is almost invariably followed by manifestations of secondary syphilis , which , in turn , precede a period of latency . in the period of early latent syphilis ( up to 1 year after contact ) relapses of secondary syphilis can occur in 25% of cases , but after this period no recurrence develops . the evolution of late latent syphilis ( 1 year after contact ) is governed by the classical rule of thirds . in one - third of cases there are no manifestations of disease and nontreponemal serological reactions ( venereal disease research laboratory [ vdrl ] ) of syphilis become vdrl negative . in another third , vdrl remains positive , usually with low titers , but also without any signs or symptoms of syphilis . in the last third about half of these patients have late - benign syphilis and the others have cardiovascular or neurological disease.3 syphilitic infection of the nervous system  neurosyphilis  results in the most chronic , insidious meningeal inflammatory process known.4 in the pre - antibiotic era it was estimated to account for 10%20% of asylum admissions.10 after the introduction of penicillin , it became rare . following the epidemiological data of syphilis , neurosyphilis has also increased in patients coinfected with hiv . however , it remains uncommon in non - hiv patients.11,12 the clinical picture of neurosyphilis is nonspecific and may manifest itself at any time of the natural history of disease . in hiv patients in immunocompetent individuals , the disease manifests more insidiously , with nonspecific symptoms , making the diagnosis more difficult.2 we present the case of an immunocompetent patient that sought medical attention due to sudden unilateral blindness and progressive neuropsychiatric complaints . in - hospital investigation established the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with optical involvement . the natural history , investigation , treatment , and follow - up for neurosyphilis a 60-year - old man was referred to the emergency department with a 6-month history of asthenia , insomnia , depression , anxiety , and loss of libido . the last 2 months were marked by an overall decline in memory , recurrent and very intense headaches with unilateral ocular pain , and sudden right eye visual loss . his medical history was remarkable for recurrent stroke events ( the first episode had occurred 17 years ago ) , ischemic heart disease , hypertension , and dyslipidemia . his usual medication included : acetylsalicylic acid , clopidogrel , isosorbide mononitrate , ramipril , bisoprolol , pravastatin , and clorazepate dipotassium . physical examination documented a generalized erythematous rash with scaly small patches predominantly affecting the face and extremities ( figure 1 ) . initial blood tests showed hemoglobin 13.9 g / dl , white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 7780 wbc/l ( 71% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes ) , c - reactive protein 3.7 mg / l ( normal <3 mg / l ) , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 22 mm / hr , with no additional relevant findings . initial investigation for a possible infectious etiology in the differential diagnosis of the neuropsychiatric abnormalities revealed serum reactivity to the t. pallidum particle agglutination ( tppa ) test ( table 1 ) . the patient then confirmed the appearance of a dorsal painful penile lesion , approximately 20 years ago , which had occurred some weeks after sexual risk intercourse and spontaneously resolved 4 weeks later . cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) analysis revealed : 15 wbc/l ( 11 lymphocytes/l ) glucose 0.65 g / l ( 69% of serum ) , total protein 0.97 g / l ; a positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption ( fta / abs ) test , and negative vdrl test . additional tests ruled out infection by other agents and the remaining blood analysis was unrevealing . the patient was treated for 2 weeks with penicillin g ( 4 million units intravenously every 4 hours ) and topical ophthalmic corticosteroid . vision recovery ( 20/30 , without papilledema ) was documented after 1 week and significant neuropsychiatric improvement occurred after completion of the treatment . as the skin rash did not improve after treatment , it was not considered a syphilis manifestation . six months later the patient remained asymptomatic , with no visual complaints and showing improved performances . a lumbar puncture was performed at this time and normalization of csf cytochemical characteristics was documented ( table 1 ) , excluding the need for further syphilis treatment . t. pallidum infection usually follows a typical course , with periods of active and latent disease ( figure 3).3,13 it is classified as congenital or acquired , usually acquired through sexual intercourse . the european centre for disease prevention and control additionally classifies installation of early syphilis under 1 year and late installation over and above 1 year.14 characteristically , it follows an incubation period of 1090 days before the development of an ulcerated lesion recognized as typical of primary syphilis.4 this lesion is usually single , painless , with a hard and clean base and usually located in the anogenital region . any anogenital ulcer should be considered syphilis until proven otherwise.14 the primary lesion heals in 26 weeks without treatment.4 occasionally , especially in patients coinfected with hiv , the lesion may present atypically  painful , multiple , purulent , destructive , and extra - genital.14 the penile lesion described by this patient was highly suggestive of a syphilitic ulcer since it occurred after a proper incubation period and resolved spontaneously . following a primary syphilis event , manifestations of secondary syphilis with multiorgan involvement commonly develop . subsequently , there is a latency period in which serological tests are positive but no symptoms suggestive of infection are perceived.14 the history of this patient discussed here suggests an atypical course since a period of latent syphilis developed after a remote primary infection that was not followed by any signs of a possible secondary syphilis stage ( figure 3 ) . the evolution of late latent syphilis is variable and only one - third of the cases evolve to tertiary syphilis.3 tertiary syphilis can be gummatous with clinical manifestations of space - occupying lesions , cardiovascular disease or neurosyphilis , reaching the ocular system , auricular , meningovascular , parenchymal , or even asymptomatic but with csf abnormalities.3 in the early stages of neurosyphilis , up to 512 years after primary infection , the pathological changes are limited to the perivascular infiltration of the meninges with lymphocytes and plasma cells  this condition implies arteritis and can lead to luminal occlusion due to thrombosis , ischemia , and infarction . parenchymal involvement occurs 1825 years after primary infection and is characterized by degeneration , neuronal loss , and gliosis.3,11,15 the treatment halts the progression , but recovery of neurological functions rarely occurs.3 in young adults without cardiovascular risk factors and with a clinical picture compatible with cerebral ischemia , the possibility of meningovascular syphilis must always be considered.3,11,15 this patient had apparently suffered four strokes between the ages of 43 and 50 years old . we were unable to gather any clinically relevant information from those hospitalizations at another institution . one can only speculate about the possibility of meningovascular neurosyphilis as a possible background cause for neurovascular events . ocular symptoms in syphilis are highly suggestive of neurological involvement and underlying neurosyphilis is very likely.4,11 neurosyphilis with optic involvement is well described in the literature . any patient with unexplained loss of vision should be screened for syphilis.9,14 ocular involvement can occur at any time during the course of the disease . it may be asymptomatic or present as an anterior uveitis , interstitial keratitis , retinal vasculitis , retinitis , optic neuritis , dacryoadenitis , or scleritis.1,11 optic nerve implication may be unilateral or bilateral and manifest as perineuritis , optic neuritis , and papilledema with loss of vision.4 the classic argyll robertson pupil occurs in 48%64% of patients with late parenchymal neurosyphilis.16 the diagnosis of neurosyphilis is based on clinical history , physical examination , and laboratory studies.3,11 the screening should preferentially use an antigen treponemal test  t. pallidum hemagglutination assay ( tpha ) , tppa , fta / abs test , treponemal enzyme immunoassay . rapid plasma reagin ( rpr ) tests or vdrl , both nontreponemal antigen , are not recommended as screening tests.14 after a positive screening test , the infection must be confirmed by another treponemal antigen test . the fta / abs test is not recommended as a standard confirmatory test , as it depends on highly specialized laboratories , where the quality of reagents and reproducibility of the test can be assured.14 the quantification of vdrl or rpr is recommended when there is confirmation of diagnosis and is useful for monitoring the activity of infection and response to treatment . active disease with negative serum vdrl or rpr is a rare situation.14 csf analysis should be performed in all patients with positive syphilitic serological tests and neurological , ocular , or auditory manifestations , treatment failure , or concomitant hiv infection.3,14 csf abnormalities of active neurosyphilis include : pleocytosis with 10100 wbc/l , increased number of mononuclear cells ( > 510 cells/l ) , increased protein between 0.50 g / l , positive vdrl ( 90% of cases ) , and decreased glucose concentration ( 45% of the cases).3 our hospital laboratory is not able to provide the differential count of csf wbcs whenever the cell count is < 50100 cells/l , due to lack of sensitivity of the available technique . however , csf pleocytosis was observed in our patient and absence of the differential count does not rule out neurosyphilis.14 testing for treponemal and nontreponemal reactions in the csf is the most sensitive and specific laboratory method for diagnosis of neurosyphilis . however , a nonreactive vdrl test does not exclude it.3,13 like all serological tests , regardless of the disease , the existence of false positives or false negatives must be considered ( table 2 ) . despite these available laboratory tests , it is worth noting that no single test or clinical feature can diagnose neurosyphilis and a diagnosis is usually made based on a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory tests.14 nevertheless , the laboratory results , according to the literature , are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the presented case ( table 3 ) . the use of penicillin is the recommended treatment for all stages of syphilis . in cases of ocular involvement , the use of topical steroids should also be considered.2,11 the recommended treatment for patients not allergic to penicillin is the administration of 1824 million units per day of the aqueous crystallized penicillin g intravenously in fractionated doses of 34 million u 4-hourly for 1014 days.1,3,11,1417 in penicillin - allergic patients , desensitization to penicillin or use of erythromycin or ceftriaxone should be considered.14 ocular syphilis should be treated like any other form of neurosyphilis . antibiotics in combination with topical steroids should be considered.1,11 usually there is a good therapeutic response , which is not affected by the presence of hiv infection.1,3,11,14,17 lumbar puncture must be repeated every 6 months until cell counts normalize . syphilis remains a great imitator because its clinical expression is not pathognomonic and it may be misdiagnosed when superimposed on chronic diseases . neurosyphilis , particularly its atypical forms characterized by nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms , remains a diagnostic challenge . the definitive diagnosis relies on the correct interpretation of laboratory tests of peripheral blood and csf , in addition to a suggestive clinical history . this case illustrates the importance of keeping a high grade of suspicion of neurosyphilis in immunocompetent patients with ocular and neuropsychiatric complaints since its nonrecognition may have serious and irreversible consequences . depending on the baseline neurological status , early and adequate treatment with penicillin and steroids may restore eye integrity and prevent serious damaging of the central nervous system . rui paulo rodrigues made substantial contributions in gathering patient data and performed an extensive

       "  'abstract': 'backgroundneurosyphilis became a rare disease after the introduction of antibiotics .   the resurgence of syphilis in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection in the past decades increased the incidence of this tertiary form of the disease .   however , in immunocompetent patients neurosyphilis remains uncommon and accurate diagnosis is challenging as the clinical presentation is unspecific and the validity of supportive laboratory tests is unclear.case reportwe describe the case of a 60-year - old man who presented with a 6-month clinical picture of depression - like symptoms and recent sudden unilateral blindness .   medical history uncovered a primary syphilitic event 20 years before .   the investigation led to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with optical involvement in a patient who did not present with any signs of secondary syphilis .   treatment with penicillin g and topical steroids resulted in significant clinical improvement and resolution of the visual loss.conclusionin the well - established natural history of syphilis , primary syphilis is almost always followed by manifestation of the secondary form , which in turn precedes a period of latency .   this case emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion of neurosyphilis in an immunocompetent patient with nonspecific neuropsychiatric manifestations and an atypical course of syphilis infection .',\n",

corrected visual acuities were 20/200 in both eyes , and there was no chamber reaction in either eye . vitreous cells were positive at grade 2 + in both eyes and fundus examination showed bilateral serious retinal detachments with elschnig 's spots in the left eye ( fig . 1 ) . optical coherence tomography ( oct ) revealed macular subretinal serous fluids in both eyes , with a minimum foveal thickness of 944 um in the right eye and 818 um in the left eye ( fig . 2 ) . fluorescence angiography ( fa ) in the early phase showed delayed choroidal filling and hypofluorescence in the macula , followed by mid - phase punctuate hyperfluorescence at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium clustered along the boundaries of the detached retina ( fig . late phase fa was apparent for diffuse late leakage and fluorescence staining in the area of exudative retinal detachment ( fig . 3b ) . icga in the early phase featured broad hypofluorescence due to a choroidal filling defect in the posterior pole ( fig . 3c ) , which was followed by mid - phase fluorescence blockage in the area of exudative retinal detachment ( fig . 3d ) . a clinical diagnosis of incomplete type vkh was considered . however , systemic evaluation revealed increased white blood cell counts ( 290,000/l ) , with an abnormally increased percentage of blast cells ( 89% ) . he received induction chemotherapy of vincristine , prednisolone , daunorubicin , l - asparaginase ( vpdl ) and high - dose steroid therapy ( prednisolone 60 mg daily ) . a week later , his best corrected visual acuities were 20/25 , and there was no chamber reaction in both eyes . vitreous cells were reduced to grade 1 + in both eyes and the serous retinal detachments were nearly absorbed in both eyes . newly developed roth spots and cotton wool patches near the optic disc were found in both eyes . although his best - corrected visual acuities improved after chemotherapy , the patient died of pulmonary hemorrhage and multiorgan failure during immunosuppression , 18 days after starting chemotherapy . visual loss after choriocapillary occlusion in leukemia was first reported by zimmerman in 1964.1 beyond that , exudative retinal detachment in leukemia has been reported in only a few cases world - wide , as a presenting sign of the disease or the first sign of relapse.1 - 8 this csc - like serous retinal detachment in leukemia has not been previously reported in south korea . this is also the first case showing characteristic prodromal symptoms of neurologic and auditory abnormalities . the presence of such symptoms preceding bilateral exudative retinal detachment is a typical feature of vkh disease , fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of incomplete vkh disease as long as there is no underlying systemic disease.9 the mechanism of serous retinal detachment in leukemia has been thought to be choroidal ischemia and secondary retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction.3,4,6,7 the choroid is the most frequently involved ocular tissue in leukemia . leukemic cell infiltration or hematologic disturbances may cause partial occlusion of the choriocapillaries and delay of choroidal circulation.10 secondary dysfunction of the bruch 's membrane and retinal pigment epithelium may ultimately develop into serous retinal detachments of the macula.3,8,11,12 ocular histologic findings by autopsy in leukemic patients have documented the features of choroidal thickening and leukemic cell infiltration that lead to choroidal ischemia.10 although we did not have histologic evidence , the fact that systemic chemotherapy induced a rapid remission of exudative retinal detachment , consistent with previous reports , suggests leukemic cell infiltration as the underlying pathology.3,4,7 this case is the first to document early and late icga findings of serous retinal detachments in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . the early phase of icga demonstrated choroidal ischemia , especially in the posterior pole , whereas choroidal filling in the normal eye always begins in the macula with initial fluorescing of subfoveal choroidal arterioles.13 after the mid - phase , choroidal fluorescence was blocked by serous retinal detachments and the details of retinal and choroidal vessels were obscured . fluorescence blockage by serous retinal fluid is also seen in csc or vkh disease , usually in the late phase of icga.14 however , the typical hypofluorescent dark dots in the mid - phase usually observed in csc or vkh disease were not seen in our case.14 this inconsistency suggests a different pathophysiology , and the penetration of icg dye may have been reduced by highly concentrated fluid in the subretinal space along with thick cellular infiltrates in the choroid . prodromal symptoms of headache , neck stiffness and tinnitus , such as in our case , followed by bilateral serous retinal detachment , may misdirect to the clinical diagnosis of incomplete type vkh disease.9 however , several features are helpful in making the differential diagnosis . first , anterior uveitis was absent in our case , which is frequently seen in vkh disease.15 second , fa findings of mid - phase multiple hyperfluorescent dots were clustered along the boundaries of the detached retina , sparing the macula ; in vkh disease such dots are usually distributed in the posterior pole.14 third , late - phase dye pooling in fa showed a unilobular csc - like feature , different from the multi - lobulated pooling seen in vkh disease.16 fourth , oct did not reveal any of the subretinal septa generally observed in vkh disease.16 finally , typical icga findings of vkh disease were absent in our case , such as mid - phase multiple hypofluorescent dots in the posterior pole.14 the prodromal symptoms that misdirected the diagnosis may have been caused by leukemic infiltration into the cerebrospinal fluid and microvasculopathy due to hyperleukocytosis.17,18 leukemia may present when there is sudden visual loss due to exudative retinal detachment , and the ophthalmologist may be the first clinician to encounter such patients . a thorough systemic evaluation should be performed in patients presenting with bilateral exudative retinal detachment , especially in those who report certain systemic symptoms .\",\n",

level food wastes in this field were also observed . we planned an operation and a simultaneous self - expandable stent implementation . computed tomography image after perforation twenty hours after the perforation , the patient was put in the lloyd davis position under general anaesthesia , and a 10-mm camera port was placed in the upper left portion of the hub . two 10-mm ports were also placed on the right and left of the mid - clavicular line , and a 5-mm port was placed on the right anterior axillary line for the liver retractor . there were no findings in the abdomen during exploration . by putting out the left and right crura , an inflamed perforation area of approximately 34 cm in size with solid food waste was observed in the distal oesophagus , which is in the upper part of the gastro - oesophageal combination on the left side [ figure 2 ] . food particles in the operation area were collected in a tissue bag ( endobag , covidien ) , and the contents were washed with 0.9% saline . no additional process was performed on the ruptured area due of tissue friability and oedema . a simultaneous upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on the patient , and a silicon coated self - expandable stent ( hanaro stent , mi tech , seoul , south korea ) was installed to cover the perforation area [ figure 3 ] . following a test with an orogastric tube that looked for leaks using methylene blue , the operation was completed by placing two silicon drains in the ruptured intra - abdominal area . perforation area determined during laparoscopy closure of the perforated area with a coated oesophageal stent the patient on whom no extravasation was detected by contrast radiography 3 days post - operative was initiated with clear liquid . in the clinical follow - up , bilateral effusion developed in the patient . as a consequence , drainage was made with bilateral pleural catheterisation ( pleurocan , 8 - 10f , b. braun , melsungen , germany ) . due to the regression of the effusion , the catheters were withdrawn on the post - operative 7 day . a 50 cc / day there was no drainage during the follow - up period or following triphasic contrast - enhanced ct of the abdomen and thorax on the post - operative 15 day . consequently , the drains were withdrawn , and the patient was discharged . at the end of the post - operative period of 8 weeks , the stent was removed [ figure 4 ] . treatment of a spontaneous oesophageal transmural rupture that develops after a sudden increase in intraluminal pressure still has challenges . factors such as perforation area , degree of contamination , time after perforation and presence of comorbidity have prognostic values in these patients whose morbidity and mortality is high . symptoms may be atypical in terms of the localisation of the oesophagus perforation , or they may imitate other diseases ( including myocardial infarction , spontaneous pneumothorax or aortic dissection ) ; furthermore , there may be a delay in diagnosis . dysphagia , sub - cutaneous emphysema , tachycardia and tachypnoea may be frequently detected in the patient . the mackler triad of severe vomiting history , sub - xiphoid chest pain and sub - cutaneous emphysema may not be observed routinely in every patient . oesophageal contrast serial radiography , endoscopy and ct may be used in the diagnosis , but tomography is quite effective in the evaluation of the perforation localisation and the surrounding tissues . the diagnosis of our patient was made using ct of the ruptured area , and the food waste inside the patient was observed via an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . the aim of the treatment of oesophageal perforation is the prevention of the development of infection , re - establishment of gastrointestinal integrity and provision of sufficient nutrition to the patient . in the presence of a perforation , attempts to repair it with abdominal or thoracic surgical approaches according to the localisation should be made . prevention of the possible development of mediastinitis via drainage of the area around the rupture should be considered . however , it should not be omitted that a thoracotomy may increase the morbidity and mortality in critical and old patients with serious comorbidities . as in the other surgical fields , minimally invasive methods ( laparoscopy or thoracoscopy ) have begun to be used in the treatment of oesophageal perforation . depending on the perforation area , laparoscopy may be used effectively in the distal oesophagus , and thoracoscopy can be effectively utilised in other localisations . while feeding , the jejunostomy may be opened via laparoscopic gastrostomy , but repair and drainage on a larger field in the oesophagus may be performed via thoracoscopy . tissues such as the intercostal muscles , pleura , omentum and pericardium pedicle flaps may be used to strengthen the repair line in the perforated area , but discussions about their efficacy remain . it has been suggested that primary suture and sufficient drainage be made in both early and late oesophageal perforation . however , only using primary suture in an oedematous and weak area may not achieve satisfactory success , especially in delayed events . studies have reported that primary oesophagus repair and drainage applied in the first 24 h after the perforation are more successful than in events longer than 24 h. while the mortality rate in events treated within the first 24 h is between 10% and 25% , after 24 h , this rate may increase to 66% . in parallel with the development of mediastinitis although our event had an early perforation , the tissue friability and inflammation inhibited primary repair . in our treatment , there was no need for a thoracotomy because we simultaneously performed laparoscopic drainage and self - expandable stent localisation ; moreover , the ruptured area was successfully closed . because surgery may increase morbidity and mortality , a treatment alternative has been created by first using metallic and then plastic stents . the perforation area is closed rapidly with the covered self - expandable stents localised in an early phase , which results in a decrease in contamination and morbidity . in a study of three patients , a metallic stent was used with the laparoscopic approach , and it was reported that this approach may be preferred in critical patients . favourable results were achieved with covered stents in benign perforations and anastomotic leakages . for the choice of treatment , patient - specific planning should be made with a multidisciplinary approach . with our laparoscopic - endoscopic cooperative surgery approach , the case utilised a minimal invasive stent and surgical drainage and was protected against the need for laparotomy and thoracotomy . any consequent morbidity that may occur would depend on these two procedures . as a result , in events with spontaneous perforation localised to the lower oesophagus , intra - abdominal organs may be evaluated by laparoscopy , without a need for thoracotomy . the mediastinum and pleura may be viewed by opening the crus , and food particles in the ruptured area may be cleaned , and sufficient drainage may be provided . furthermore , extra - luminal leakage may be prevented by the localisation of an intraluminal silicon - coated self - expandable stent in the oesophagus via an endoscopy during the operation . the sufficiency of the process may be assessed with contrast agents accompanied with methylene blue or fluoroscopy given through the oesophagus during laparoscopy . simultaneous laparoscopy and stent application in events with spontaneous lower oesophageal perforation should be considered as an effective treatment choice alternative to conventional treatment methods .',\n",

however , the primary extranodal forms are rare and account for less than 1% , git being the most common site . in view of its rare occurrence , diagnosis has to be made in accordance with histological as well as other clinical and radiological criteria . these can be outlined as : ( a ) no superficial lymphadenopathy should be present at the time of diagnosis ( b ) no involvement of mediastinal lymph node on chest imaging ( c ) complete blood count and wbc differential should be within normal limits ( d ) predominance of git lesion with or without positive adjacent lymph node ( e ) liver and spleen should be disease free at the time of diagnosis . the present case fulfilled all the criteria and was thus categorized as primary gastrointestinal hl . a case has been reported to be associated with cholelithiasis and ileocaecal intussusception , ileum being the most common site . it has been well - documented that ileum is rich in lymphoid follicles hence , neoplastic transformation due to changes in immune response can occur . because it is rare for hl to localize to the small intestine , any diagnosis of the small bowel hl should prompt a thorough search for additional disease at the other site . hl presenting with primary bowel involvement is a unique clinical entity , despite the frequent inclusion of hl in various series of malignant lymphoma , reports on primary lesion of the small intestine are rare . a series of literature revealed only seven cases of intestinal hl out of 778 git lymphomas . in a case series , out of 24 cases of lymphoma of the git five cases of hl were reported . however , only two cases of primary hl were encountered out of a total of 117 patients who presented with gastrointestinal lymphoma . only 11 individual patients with small intestine hl were recorded since 1967 . however , their diagnosis was in doubt due to lack of ihc staining . many of these patients were thought to resemble hl histologically such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma shows atypical cells resembling rs cells , similarly a highly differentiated carcinoma or multiple myeloma could also mimic hl with large rs like cells in a background of inflammatory cells . in the present case , the large atypical cells were negative for activin receptor - like kinase-1 ruling out anaplastic large cell lymphoma . emphasis has to be laid on the importance of ihc . with currently available ihc techniques these histologically similar tumors can be readily differentiated from hl . in the present case , to conclude , since it is rare for hl to localize in the small intestine without involvement of regional or distant lymph nodes , any diagnosis of small bowel hl should prompt a thorough search for additional disease at other sites . histological confirmation by ihc technique supports the diagnosis of small intestinal hl to be valid . all the criteria for inclusion should be adhered to for a conclusive diagnosis of a primary hl of the intestine .\",\n",

smx was continued for 6 weeks . at a 3-month follow - up after discontinuation of tmp - smx , was performed by broth microdilution method as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) guidelines ( 4 ) . conventional automated methods such as the vitek ii system ( biomerieux , hazelwood , mo ) were unable to identify this isolate [ \" smc -

resistant n. farcinica in immunocompromized hosts were successfully treated with linezolid ( 2 , 16 , 18 ) . identification of clinical isolates using conventional automated methods usually is reported as the genus nocardia ( \\' nocardia species \\' ) , rather than to the species level . given the aforementioned antibiotic resistance concerns posed by n. farcinica , it is prudent to suggest that molecular identification or antimicrobial susceptibility test for nocardia species should be performed when \\' nocardia species \\' is isolated from a specimen culture to ensure proper treatment . often , antimicrobial therapy is continued for several months after apparent cure because of a concern of high relapse rates of nocardiosis . while it has been suggested that pulmonary or systemic nocardiosis in immunocompromized hosts should be treated for 6 - 12 months ( 12 ) , another report suggested that prolonged antibiotics may not be necessary in nocardial crbsi without distant metastatic infection after removal of catheter ( 8) . presently , the patient was successfully treated with parenteral tmp - smx for 10 days and a subsequent 6-week course of oral formulation after removal of the cvc . specific recommendations for catheter removal in nocardial crbsi have not been forthcoming . a report suggested that nocardial bacteremia can be successfully treated without removing vascular catheters ( 11 ) , while other case was relapsed after management of keeping cvc ( 19 ) . three cases were treated with removal of cvc ( 10 , 20 ) . in this report , the patient became afebrile after cvc removal and administration of parenteral tmp - smx . removal of the catheter is not absolutely indicated but should be seriously considered prompt removal of catheter when a patient with crbsi caused by nocardia species does not respond to appropriate antimicrobial agent(s ) . the present novel report of crbsi caused by n. farcinica indicates that n. farcinica should be included as a causative microorganism of crbsi . molecular identification for nocardia species as well as antimicrobial susceptibility test will be helpful for proper treatment with antimicrobials because antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are variable between nocardia spp .',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'nocardia farcinica is an emerging pathogen in immunocompromised hosts . even though several species of nocardia have been reported as causative pathogens of catheter - related blood stream infections ( crbsi ) , crbsi caused by n. farcinica has not been reported .   a 70-yr - old man with a tunneled central venous catheter ( cvc ) for home parenteral nutrition was admitted with fever for two days .   norcardia species was isolated from the blood through cvc and peripheral bloods and identified to n. farcinica by 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses .   this report emphasizes the rapid and correct identification of causative agents in infectious diseases in the selection of antimicrobial agents and the consideration of catheter removal .',\n",

       " {'article': 'statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme - a reductase inhibitors and are very effective in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality . in recent years , higher doses of statins are increasingly used since they have a better cardioprotective effect compared with lower doses . despite a widespread clinical use of statins for more than two decades , no significant renal adverse effects were reported , except for a very rare occurrence of rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury ( aki ) and hence were considered safe . rhabdomyolysis due to statins is very rare , with a reported incidence of 3.4/100,000 patient - years . on the contrary , there is some evidence to suggest that statins exert renoprotective effect , when used prior to cardiac surgery and contrast use . the national lipid association kidney expert panel reviewed the published and unpublished evidence in 2006 and found no evidence to suggest that statins cause renal injury . however , since then there has been a growing concern about statin induced renal toxicity . we report a case of aki due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by atorvastatin and aki recurred after a challenge with another statin , rosuvastatin . a 54-year - old man was detected to have hyperlipidemia and was prescribed atorvastatin 20 mg and a multivitamin capsule 1 month prior to initial consultation and and received no other drug . he was detected to have diabetes mellitus 6 months ago , but received no medication . he felt unwell after taking atorvastatin and on evaluation had normal renal function ( blood urea : 38 mg / dl , serum creatinine [ scr ] : 1.1 mg / dl ) . since he continued to feel tired , he had a review 3 weeks later and was detected to have azotemia ( blood urea : 54 mg / dl , scr : 1.9 mg / dl ) and was referred to our unit . he complained of tiredness , but did not have fever , skin rash , muscle weakness or tenderness . he denied taking any other drug , including indigenous or over the counter medications , other than atorvastatin and multivitamin capsule . he was thought to have aki due to atorvastatin and it was discontinued . after 1 week scr rose to 2.4 mg / dl and he underwent renal biopsy , which showed nine glomeruli , of which one showed periglomerular fibrosis . moderate interstitial round cell infiltrates [ figure 1 ] were seen along with few eosinophils . immunoflurescence study showed minimal mesangial deposits of immunoglobulin m and was negative for other immunoglobulins and c3 . microscopy of renal biopsy ( a : 10 ; b : 40 ) showing acute interstitial nephritis he was started on oral prednisolone 1 mg / kg / day for 2 weeks and then slowly tapered the dose over 2 months and stopped . the response to corticosteroid was good and scr improved to 1.3 mg / dl at the end of 2 months [ figure 2 ] . serum creatinine over period after starting atorvastatin 20 mg ( solid line ) and after rechallenge with another statin , rosuvastatin 10 mg ( interrupted line ) . black arrow indicates initiation of corticosteroid ; white arrow , indicates withdrawal of statin he was admitted 6 months after the initial presentation with acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) and underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) and stenting . he was given atorvastatin 40 mg post ptca , but was replaced with rosuvastatin 10 mg after 2 days in view of previous allergic interstitial nephritis attributed to atorvastatin . he was explained about the possible cross reactivity with atorvastatin and scr was monitored on weekly basis . scr was 1.4 mg / dl at the initiation of rosuvastatin therapy and gradually increased to a peak of 1.8 mg / dl at 4 weeks [ figure 2 ] . ( 55 u / l ) and there was no evidence of any other etiologic factor to account for aki during this period . the renal biopsy was not repeated since antiplatelet drugs could not be stopped so early after ptca and steroid were not given in view of possible worsening of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia . scr returned to baseline value spontaneously over next 2 months and remained stable over next 12 months . we present a case of aki in a 54-year - old man , which occurred about 4 weeks after initiation of atorvastatin ( 20 mg ) and no other cause could be identified to explain aki . renal biopsy showed features of acute interstitial nephritis with interstitial infiltration with mononuclear cells and occasional eosinophils . he had a marked recovery of renal function following withdrawal of the drug and steroid therapy . six months later , he was initiated on rosuvastatin ( 10 mg ) following ami after which there was a gradual increase in scr by 0.5 mg / dl over the baseline to a peak value of 1.8 mg / dl . scr spontaneously returned to baseline gradually over the next 2 months after withdrawal of rosuvastatin . hippisley - cox and coupland reported in a large study from uk that statin use was associated with significantly increased risk of aki , which was dose dependent and was seen across all statins , except rosuvastatin . more recently , dormuth et al . , in a study of over 2 million patients who were newly treated with a statin , found a significant relative increase of 34% in the rate of hospitalization for aki within 120 days of initiation for patients receiving high potency statins versus low potency statins . though rosuvastatin is more potent and has a longer half - life , there is no evidence to suggest that rosuvastatin is more nephrotoxic than atorvastatin . acute kidney injury due to statins is probably under recognized and hence under reported due to following reasons : \\n patients who generally receive statins are elderly , have several comorbid conditions such as diabetes , hypertension , atherosclerotic renovascular disease which are confounding factors for renal dysfunction and receive several drugs such as renin angiotensin aldosterone blocking agents and diuretics that can cause akithey often receive antiplatelet agents and hence may not undergo renal biopsy for aki , andacute or subacute tubule - interstitial nephritis due to statins may be subtle and subclinical and hence may go unrecognized when not routinely monitored for renal function . \\n  patients who generally receive statins are elderly , have several comorbid conditions such as diabetes , hypertension , atherosclerotic renovascular disease which are confounding factors for renal dysfunction and receive several drugs such as renin angiotensin aldosterone blocking agents and diuretics that can cause aki they often receive antiplatelet agents and hence may not undergo renal biopsy for aki , and acute or subacute tubule - interstitial nephritis due to statins may be subtle and subclinical and hence may go unrecognized when not routinely monitored for renal function . the pathophysiological mechanisms of the increased incidence of aki reported in recent epidemiological studies remains unclear . however , the data from jupiter study , which was subsequently reported to food and drug administration showed that only 1 out of 8901 patients who received rosuvastatin 20 mg developed rhabdomyolysis ( 0.01% ) , whereas aki was seen 19 ( 0.21% ) patients and another 16 ( 0.18% ) developed doubling of scr , indicating that rhabdomyolysis did not account for aki in them . another putative cause for aki is statin induced suppression of production of coenzyme q10 ( coq-10 ) , which has antioxidant properties . coq10 is reported to have renoprotective effect in experimental aki in animals and humans with chronic kidney disease . londrino et al . , reported a case of rosuvastatin induced biopsy proven acute interstitial nephritis in an 83-year - old male , who showed complete recovery following withdrawal of the drug and steroid therapy . described a case similar to ours in which rosuvastatin caused aki due to renal tubular toxicity , which resolved after the withdrawal of the drug . a renal biopsy showed both acute as well as chronic interstitial nephritis . later on the introduction of atorvastatin at 40 mg produced similar pattern of aki , which resolved when the dose was reduced to 20 mg . these and our case report suggest acute or subacute interstitial nephritis as another possible cause of aki due to statins . despite several recent reports of increased nephrotoxicity due to statins , it is admittedly rare . the current evidence does not support the notion that our current practice to use of statins should be restricted in population who are likely to benefit from its use , for fear of potential nephrotoxicity . however , clinicians should be aware of a potential renal toxicity of statins , especially at higher doses . we feel that it would be a prudent practice for the clinicians to be vigilant and routinely monitor renal function during the first few months after initiation of statin , especially when higher doses of statin is used . we report a case of aki due acute interstitial nephritis caused by atorvastatin , which resolved after withdrawal of the drug and steroid therapy . on rechallenge with rosuvastatin after 6 months , he developed aki again , which resolved after withdrawal of the drug . our results suggest a possible direct or immune mediated renal interstitial injury as a possible mechanism for statin induced aki .',\n",

onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( nomid).1 autoinflammatory syndromes are systemic disorders which result in repeated inflammatory symptoms such as fever , rash , and arthritis in the absence of autoantibodies with high titer or antigen - specific t lymphocytes.1 it is different from infection , autoimmunity , allergy , and immunodeficiency.1 caps is caused by gain - of - function mutations in the nucleotide - binding domain and leucine - rich repeat - containing protein 3 ( nlrp3 ) within the cryopyrin gene.2nlrp3 mutations increase activity of the interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) inflammasome and lead to excessive production of il-1 , a proinflammatory cytokine.2 thus , genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis of caps.2 caps is an autosomal dominant disease and the syndrome generally presents in early childhood.3 clinical findings include urticarial - like rash , periodic fever , inflammation of the central nervous system , meningitis , optic disc swelling , deafness , and arthropathy.35 ocular manifestations of caps are not fully understood , although it is known to cause optic disc changes , anterior uveitis , and corneal involvement.4 in this case study , we report caps associated with optic disc swelling . in 2009 , a 35-year - old japanese male visited the dermatology clinic of our hospital presenting with urticarial - like rash from infancy , periodic fever , and arthralgia . he also presented with deafness , repeated eye redness , ocular pain , headache , and general fatigue from the time he was a child . at first , behet s disease was suspected based on his symptoms . consequently , he was seen for diagnosis in the ophthalmology clinic at our hospital in september 2009 . his best - corrected visual acuity was 1.0 od and 0.9 os and his manifest refraction was uncorrected ou . slit - lamp examination showed conjunctival and episcleral injection in both eyes , clear and smooth corneas , and infiltration of inflammatory cells without posterior synechia in the anterior chamber . ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography examination revealed obvious bilateral optic disc swelling and retinal vascular sheathing around the optic discs , with absence of dilated capillaries on the optic discs , vitreous opacifications , and retinal exudates ( figure 1 ) . hematologic examination showed increased inflammatory markers , a white blood cell count of 18,700 cells/l ( neutrophil count 75.5% , lymphocyte count 20.5% ) , c - reactive protein of 2.94 mg / dl , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 44 mm . the patient was also treated at the department of rheumatology and clinical immunology with immunosuppressive agents ( methotrexate , tacrolimus , azathioprine , cyclophosphamide ) and antirheumatic agents ( salazosulfapyridine , leflunomide ) to reverse systemic symptoms . however , conjunctival and episcleral injection and systemic symptoms played a limited role in these treatments . three years later , his best - corrected visual acuity was 1.2 od and 1.2 os . the optic discs became white in color ( figure 1 ) and fluorescein angiography demonstrated strong staining and weak late phase leakage from the optic disc ( figure 3 ) . spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( spectralis , heidelberg engineering , heidelberg , germany ) revealed obvious optic disc swelling ( figure 1 ) . in 2012 , therefore , the patient underwent genetic testing for the diagnosis of caps at kyoto university graduate school of medicine after informed consent was obtained , according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki . genetic tests detected heterozygous mutations in c.907g > a [ p.asp303asn ( d303n ) ] , a previously reported mutation responsible for caps . caps consists of three clinical categories , and the familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome is the mildest condition.3 the muckle  wells syndrome presents an intermediate condition between familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and cinca / nomid.3 cinca / nomid is the most severe condition.3 common manifestations include urticarial - like rash and periodic fever.3 clinical criteria for diagnosis of each individual syndrome have been previously reported.68 according to these reports , cinca / nomid presents with urticarial - like rash , periodic fever , inflammation of the central nervous system , and arthropathy.68 our patient presented with a severe phenotype , including skin erythema , arthralgia , inflammation of the central nervous system , optic disc swelling , meningitis , and deafness . additionally , alteration of the nucleotide c.907g > a was detected , and previously has been reported as being associated with the phenotypes of cinca / nomid and muckle  wells syndromes.9 consequently , we identified this patient as having cinca / nomid or muckle  wells syndrome . the international cinca / nomid ocular study group reported ocular manifestations of cinca / nomid in 2000.4 however , at that time caps had no known cause . according to the report , of 31 patients , 26 ( 84% ) had optic disc changes , including optic disc edema , pseudopapilledema , and optic atrophy , 13 patients ( 42% ) presented with chronic eye redness , including chronic perilimbal injection and chronic conjunctivitis , 17 patients ( 55% ) had chronic anterior uveitis , and none of the patients had increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma.4 our case also demonstrated optic disc changes , chronic conjunctivitis , episcleritis , and anterior uveitis . we think that the optic disc change in our case is optic edema , because fluorescein angiography demonstrated late phase leakage and ophthalmoscopy showed retinal vascular sheathing . terrada et al reported a case of caps , and the patient had optic disc changes related to chronic intracranial hypertension due to cerebrospinal fluid inflammation.10 we do not know whether our patient presented with intracranial hypertension because lumbar puncture was not performed in this case . however , there were no space - occupying brain lesions produced by raised intracranial pressure observed with magnetic resonance imaging . first , the optic disc change in our patient may be caused by ocular specific inflammation , because ophthalmoscopy revealed retinal vascular sheathing around the optic discs . second , inflammation of the central nervous system may lead to optic disc change , because he had a previous history of meningitis . we hypothesize that the optic disc change in caps was due to ocular specific inflammation , inflammation of the central nervous system , or raised intracranial pressure . the cinca / nomid group reported that 19 of 30 patients with cinca / nomid had adequate visual acuity or mild visual loss.4 the patient in our study also had adequate visual acuity . cinca / nomid generally occurs with severe systemic symptoms and optic disc changes.4 however , the report found only eight patients ( 27% ) had severe visual loss.4 the authors hypothesized that a cause may be the lack of long - term systematic review in many patients.4 the duration of clinical follow - up in our case was also approximately 4 years . in the future usually steroids , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and immunosuppressive agents are not effective for caps.3 in our study , these drugs had little effect on the patient s symptoms . caps is caused by mutations of the nlrp3 gene that encodes for cryopyrin protein.2 cryopyrin protein is part of an inflammasome complex , and regulates production and secretion of the potent proinflammatory cytokine il-1 in blood myeloid cells.2 thus , anti - inflammatory drugs directed at il-1 , such as anakinra , rilonacept , and canakinumab , are used for treatment of caps.1113 in conclusion , we showed that the main ocular findings in our case were optic disc swelling , chronic conjunctivitis , episcleritis , and chronic anterior uveitis , without elevated intraocular pressure and peripheral anterior synechia . hence , clinicians must distinguish caps from other disorders when examining optic disc swelling and/or uveitis patients with urticarial -

       " {'article': 'although tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)- inhibitors have been used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis for more than a decade,13 their effect on ra - associated ild ( rheumatoid arthritis  associated interstitial lung disease ) have been rarely reported . tnf- is one of most important cytokines in the early immune response to a variety of inflammatory disorders , and is a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.4 tnf- can directly stimulate the secretion of matrix proteins , increase fibroblast proliferation , and promote induction of matrix - degrading gelatinases that can facilitate fibroblast migration to site of injury.5 increased expression of tnf- gene is observed in fibrotic human lungs as well as animal models of lung fibrosis , and inhibition of tnf- expression can significantly reduce the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis.6 therefore , tnf- inhibitors have potential for the treatment of ra - associated ild . here we report a case of ra - associated ild whose condition was improved after etanercept ( a recombinant tnf- blocker ) treatment . a 52-year - old woman first experienced knee pain and swelling bilaterally in may 2002 , followed by gradual emergence of pain and swelling in wrist , metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints in both hands , with morning stiffness lasting more than one hour . in august 2002 , rheumatoid arthritis was confirmed . methotrexate ( mtx ) ( 10 mg / w ) plus leflunomide ( 10 mg / d ) were used to control her disease . she was admitted to hospital in june 2006 for aggravation of joint symptoms with irregular low heat , cough during the preceding two months . physical examinations disclosed fine moist rales in the lower location of the lungs , tenderness and swelling at both knees and both wrists , and toe joints deformities . laboratory testing demonstrated an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 66 mm / h , a c - reactive protein of 50.30 mg / l , a rheumatoid factor of 21.9 iu / ml , an anti - ccp antibody of 58 ru / ml , but negative for antinuclear antibodies . high - resolution ct scan of the chest showed lung markings increased , part of the grid - like changes , interlobular septa thickening , and patchy density - enhanced shadow . pulmonary function tests demonstrated a slight restrictive ventilation dysfunction with severe small airway obstruction , but the diffusing capacity was normal . she had no history of smoking , and denied a history of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse a diagnosis of ra - associated ild was made . the patient received the following medications at presentation : prednisone , 30 mg / d ; azathioprine 100 mg / d , triptergium glycoside 30 mg / d . after leaving . her joint s condition was improved , but the symptoms of cough and expectoration were not improved . in january 2007 , the patient was admitted to hospital again because of a repeated cough with . on examination of the lungs high - resolution ct scan of the chest showed bilateral lung interstitial lesions and emphysema , mediastinal lymphadenopathy . pulmonary function tests revealed mixed ventilatory disorder , severe obstruction in small airway function ( vc 73.0% , fev 69.2% ) , small reduction in diffusing capacity ( tlco / va 69.2% ) . in february 2007 , she began receiving 25 mg of etanercept , subcutaneously injected twice weekly , along with prednisone ( 10 mg / d ) . during six month treatment we found that her right - side basilar moist rales disappeared and left - side basilar moist rales could still be detected . chest radiography showed middle and lower lung markings were reduced and the marked improvements were also confirmed by high - resolution ct . in july 2007 pulmonary function tests suggested a slight restrictive ventilation dysfunction , with moderate small airway function obstruction ( vc 76.7% , fev 72.9% ) and normal diffusion capacity ( tlco / va 89.2% ) . before and after the treatment of etanercept this is the first report documenting ra - associated ild treated with etanercept in china . we found that pulmonary function in a female patient with ra - associated ild was improved after etanercept treatment for 6 months . ild is the most common manifestation of pulmonary disease in rheumatoid arthritis which severely affects prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis , and its secondary pulmonary fibrosis is one of the causes of death . however , the conventional treatments of ild associated to ra are not effective , and some new drugs such as interferon- , pirfenidone , acetyl - cysteine , endothelin receptor antagonist , 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor are still in the stages of clinical trials.7 in 2002 , vassallo et al8 first treated a patient with ra - associated ild for 1 yr with anti - tumor necrosis factor- infliximab . the patient is a 71-year - old man with a 3-year history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis . approximately a year following the onset of joint symptoms , progressive dyspnea and dry cough appeared . laboratory testing demonstrated a po2 at rest of 75 mm hg , which declined to 51 mm hg following mild exercise . following 1 year of therapy with infliximab , along with the improvement in joint symptoms , the patient sustained improvements in dyspnea , dry cough , and exercise tolerance . pulmonary function demonstrated a normal saturation at rest and a saturation decline to only 90% following mild exercise . in 2004 , bargagli et al9 also reported a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary fibrosis whose condition was improved after 15 months of infliximab treatment . lung function tests ( lft ) showed increases of 17% in tlco ( from 65% to 82% ) , and 11% in vc ( from 73% to 84% ) ; in contrast , high - resolution ct scan of the chest , which showed bibasilar mantellar fibrosis with honeycombing , was not altered after 15 months of therapy . similar to our case , these results suggests a tumor necrosis factor- inhibitor may be more effective on acute exudative lesions of ra - associated ild by improving lung function , but has poor effects on chronic pulmonary fibrosis . it is expected to have a better efficacy if used at the early stage of ra - associated ild . it has been documented that methotrexate ( mtx ) can induce ild whose frequency is around 1%5%.10 mtx induced- ild is characterized by the occult onset after mtx use and improvement after stopping while recurrence of lung symptoms after repeated use . it is dif - ficult to distinguish it from ra - associated ild from clinic and imaging feathers . although having a history of mtx treatment , our patient was treated only for 1 year , 2 years before receiving a diagnosis of ra - associated ild . it is clear that mtx use can not explain the occurrence of ild , because mtx had been stopped for nearly 4 years , and the patient s diffuse capacity had not been improved until using etanercept . it has been reported that etanercept can induce ild or its aggravation.11 however , our patient have ild before etanercept , and her condition improved markedly after etanercept . triptergium is a chinese herb which is used in chronic inflammatory disorders , we have not find any article reporting triptolide can induce ild or its aggravation through a medline search . in conclusion , this study suggests etanercept may be effective in the treatment of ra - associated ild .',\n",

       " {'article': \"congenital epulis is a reactive or degenerative lesion with a mesenchymal origin rather than a true neoplasm . neumann first described congenital epulis in 1871 , hence it is also known as neumann 's tumor.[35 ] congenital epulis occurs as a well - defined , pedunculated mass , with a smooth or lobulated surface . congenital epulis commonly arises from the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge of the newborn , and isnot associated with any other congenital malformations . thislesion is rare as reviewed by zuker and buenecha in 1993 , who have described only 167 reported cases in literature . congenital epulis has a female predilection , with an 8:1 ratio ; an endogenous ( intrauterine ) hormonal stimulus is proposed , but has been disproved because of the absence of a receptor for estrogen and progesterone.[36 ] congenital epulis usually occurs as a single mass , although 10% of the cases occur as multiple masses . in our case a six - day - old female child was referred from the department of pediatrics , with multiple swellings protruding from the mouth , which were noticed at birth.[figure 1 ] . antenatal history of pregnancy was uneventful and normal vaginal delivery occurred at 37 completed weeks . the baby weighed 3.5 kg , and had two large lesions on the alveolar ridge of the maxilla and three smaller lesions on the mandible [ figure 1 ] . shows multiple oral tumors the masses were pedunculated and covered with mucosa , which was macroscopically normal and had brisk capillary refill . on clinical examination , a round , pedunculated , 3 cm diameter , soft tissue mass , exhibiting an erythematous and smooth surface , was found in the midline and was attached to the anterior gingiva . three other soft tissue masses of 1.5 cm each were also found attached to the mandibles , which were smooth surfaced . two masses were attached laterally and one at the midline of the mandible . at presentation a nasogastric tube had been placed due to feeding difficulties and the baby was breathing normally . the swellings had not increased in size in the last six days . the patient also had a depressed nasal bridge , with decreased nasal patency ; however , no other structural abnormality was detected . the patient underwent fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) , which showed a benign fibrous lesion . the midline lesion was gently pushed laterally and subsequently oral intubation could be performed with some effort . a regular oral feed was started on the seventh postoperative day and was well tolerated . the patient was discharged with her mother on the ninth day . at a three - week follow - up , follow up for two months showed no recurrence.[figure 2 ] after surgical excision of the tumor the cut surface of the specimen showed a homogenous , grayish white tissue , which on histopathological examination showed a growth covered with mildly acanthotic squamous epithelium and underlying connective tissue showing closely packed polygonal cells , with centrally placed nuclei and a markedly granular cytoplasm and inflammatory cells . these findings were consistent with congenital granular cell epulis [ figure 3 , histopathological picture ] . congenital epulis occurs in the mucosa of the maxillary alveolus as a smooth - surfaced pink mass , usually not associated with any other abnormality of the teeth or other congenital abnormalities . congenital epulis causing superior deviation of the upper lip , flat nose with absence of the anterior nasal spine , and reduced anteroposterior dimension of the maxilla has been reported , as in our case , where there was a depressed nose with deviated upper lip . congenital epulis usually occurs as a single mass although 10% of the cases occur as multiple masses . in our case congenital epulis ( ce ) of the newborn is the widely accepted term and is preferred over congenital granular cell tumor ( cgct ) , which is of neoplastic origin . the absence of local recurrence even after incomplete excision , the possibility of spontaneous regression , and the lack of a malignant counterpart all favour that ce is a non - neoplastic lesion . the various proposed cells of origin are of the odontogenic epithelium , undifferentiated mesenchymal cells , pericytes , fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells , nerve related cells , and histiocytes . based on the above findings , it is concluded that the biologic behavior of congenital epulis is compatible with embryonic hamartoma . the use of the term epulis has been disagreed upon because of the presence of the same type of lesion in another part of the body , apart from the alveolar ridge . histologically , these lesions appear similar to granular cell tumors ; however , congenital epulis is negative for s-100 and other markers found in granular cell tumors . pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia , a frequent finding in granular cell tumors , is generally not present in congenital epulis . the differential diagnosis of a large mass in the fetal or neonatal oral cavity should include congenital malformations , such as , ce , teratoma , encephalocele , lymphatic malformation , hemangiomas , and neuroectodermal tumors .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'root resection therapy is said to be a treatment option for molars with periodontal , endodontic , restorative , or prosthetic problems . it is mentioned that commonly sighted indications for root resection are periodontal based , such as severe bone loss , class ii or class iii furcation involvement , severe recession , or dehiscence . endodontic indications include the inability to fill a canal , root fracture , root perforation , root resorption , and root decay . prosthetic indications include severe root proximity and root trunk fracture or decay . in a maxillary molar , root respective therapy can be used when attachment loss , caries , or a fracture involves a furcation area.[13 ] furthermore , it is stated that root resection can be an alternative treatment in a molar tooth having endodontic  periodontal problem , such as true combined lesion where root resection may allow changing the root configuration of the part of the root to be saved . external root resorption , a condition originating in the periodontal ligament and associated with loss of cementum and/or dentin from the roots of teeth , can occur due to several causes . pressure root resorption , due to impingement of an adjacent cyst , granuloma , neoplasm , juxtaposed roots , and impacted tooth , could be one of them . endodontic therapy is not suggested in a tooth having extensive external root resorption and extraction is often the treatment of choice . however , it is suggested that root resection could be a viable treatment option to salvage and retain a part of the multirooted or molar tooth , especially of one having strategic importance . this case report illustrates root resection carried out before the completion of endodontic therapy and immediately during surgery , employed for eliminating the cause for external pressure resorption , to salvage the remaining portion of a strategically important tooth . a 31-year - old female patient reported with a complaint of pain and pus discharge in the upper right second molar region , that is , 17 since 1 week . clinical examination revealed an intraoral swelling on the buccal aspect of 17 and 18 , with a sinus opening [ figure 1a ] . clinically , 17 appeared intact , whereas 18 was partially impacted ; 17 was tender on percussion and gave no response to thermal and electric pulp testing . periodontal findings were within normal limits , except for an 8 mm periodontal pocket on the distal aspect of 17 . intraoral periapical radiograph showed resorption of distobuccal root of 17 due to impingement of mesioangularly impacted 18 [ figure 1b . ] sinus opening was traced using gutta - percha point , which pointed toward the root apex of 17 .

( e ) surgical view following extraction of 18 and resection of distobuccal root of 17 . ( g ) extracted distobuccal root of 17 showing resorption ( black arrow ) following diagnosis of external pressure resorption of distobuccal root and pulpal necrosis in 17 , root canal therapy was suggested . access was opened followed by canal location and working length determination under rubber dam isolation . root canal cleaning and shaping was carried out using k - files ( maillefer dentsply , baillaigues , switzerland ) and step back technique to conserve coronal radicular dentin . calcium hydroxide ( calcicur , voco , cuxhaven , germany ) was placed as an intracanal medicament . however , sinus opening showed no healing despite changing intracanal medicament over multiple visits and the patient was suggested to undergo extraction of 18 . inspection of the socket revealed the exposure of resorbed distobuccal root of 17 and the poor prognosis due to extensive bone loss around the root was evident [ figure 1c ] . however , 17 was a strategically important tooth due to its distal most position in the arch . therefore , decision to resect distobuccal root was taken to salvage the remaining portion of 17 . following extraction of 18 , access to the root was readily available under the reflected flap . hence , decision to immediately resect the root in the same surgical field two vertical cuts were initiated in the furcation and along the crown using a long shank thin , tapering diamond point . first cut was initiated on the buccal aspect , whereas the second cut was made on the distal aspect of 17 . both the vertical cuts were carried through the furcation toward the center of the tooth and connected with each other to separate the distobuccal root [ figure 1d ] . following complete separation , the root along with a portion of the crown was removed out and radiographically verified [ figure 1e and f ] . the flap was repositioned , sutured , and postoperative instructions were given to the patient . sinus opening along with site of extraction and resection showed normal healing . following this , remaining root canals of 17 were obturated with gutta percha ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) , sealer ( ah plus , dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) using lateral compaction technique . the access along with resected portion of the crown was restored with silver amalgam ( dispersalloy , dentsply - caulk , milford , pa , usa ) [ figure 2a and b ] . in the subsequent visit , tooth preparation was done on 17 for full crown with a fluted design and knife edge finish line in the resected area [ figure 2c and 2d ] . full metal crown was fabricated with a concave contour at the resected area and cemented on 17 [ figure 2e ] . at 1 year recall visit , ( b ) radiographic view following completion of endodontic therapy and amalgam foundation in 17 . ( e ) full metal crown , having concave contour at the resected area , cemented on 17 . root resections suggested for periodontal reasons are presurgically evaluated and carried out as a part of pocket elimination surgery following elevation of flap . however , in certain situations , when the presurgical identification for resection is impossible , the need to resect the root arises at the time of surgery and if decided , root sectioning is performed during surgery . in the present case similar situation , but due to a nonperiodontal cause , occurred when poor prognosis of resorbed root was determined at the time of surgery and immediate resection was carried out . extraction of 18 was carried out as the sinus opening showed no healing , probably due to severe bone loss between 17 and 18 . flap elevation and extraction of 18 confirmed the bone loss and poor prognosis associated with 17 . however , extraction of 17 would have led to the occurrence of distal extension . therefore , resection of strategically important 17 was found beneficial to remove its resorbed distobuccal root and to salvage its remaining portion to prevent distal extension with associated drawbacks . resection was a suitable option due to the presence of nonfused roots with intact bone support around the remaining roots of 17 . since the endodontic prognosis without resection was unpredictable and due to the convenience of already available surgical access to the resorbed root , resection this prevented the need for another surgical entry and its associated trauma , in case the resection would have been carried out separately later . since resection was accomplished in the same surgical field , it was carried out before the completion of endodontic therapy in 17 . generally , endodontic therapy is completed before root resection procedure and this has many advantages . however , it is said that endodontic therapy should be delayed in cases in which the indication for root resection is not conclusively established . it may be completed postsurgically , as soon as possible , if prognosis appears to be favorable . following root resection , furthermore , radiographic identification of residual ledges or lips is difficult in maxillary molar resections . . vertical cut method of resection employed in this case , apart from reducing occlusal forces , allows smoothening of furcation due to good visibility and provides a desirable angle for resection . apart from endodontic component , a successful root resection therapy requires a comprehensive evaluation of reconstructive components too . it is shown that placement of a post decreases the fracture resistance of a tooth . however , a foundation restoration and crown are indicated following resection . foundation build up becomes increasingly difficult and technically complex if it is carried out after resection . however , in this case , foundation restoration was done after resection , as the endodontic therapy was not completed before resection . various foundation materials , such as composite resin , amalgam , and others , have been suggested . however , it is said that the differences are of little clinical significance because full coverage crowns negate these differences and afford some protection to these foundations . in this case , although amalgam has the drawbacks of causing soft tissue pigmentation ( amalgam tattoo ) and affecting healing , these were of minimal concern as it was used following healing of the resected site . amalgam has better physical properties , resist microleakage at the interface of the tooth , and less technique sensitive than composites . as a final restoration , full coverage crown was given . it is said that crown helps prevent fracture and allows the clinician to control the occlusion . it is recommended that tooth preparation for a crown on resected maxillary molars should follow contour of the root trunk . combined preparation and preparation resembling a figure 8 shape by obtaining a  barreled in  or  fluted  preparation with chamfered margins in the remaining furcation are suggested . in the present case , the resected tooth was prepared with knife - edge finish line as it is suggested that such margins , given the limited width of the residual roots , are frequently required to avoid excessive removal of residual tooth structure . the final crown was designed to have an occlusal configuration similar to a maxillary molar . it was contoured in the remaining furcation to reduce the occlusal forces over the resection area and to follow the root contour . although such a contour may not offer an ideal surface for oral hygiene procedures , it is suggested that concave shape would prevent overcontouring of the crown and minimize gingival irritation . this case report highlights that to achieve favorable endodontic prognosis in a tooth showing pressure resorption , caused by impingement of an impacted tooth , may require the extraction of impacted tooth before the completion of endodontic therapy . in such a case , flap elevated for extraction may assist in ascertaining the prognosis of resorbing tooth . furthermore , resection of resorbing root may be decided and carried out immediately in the same surgical field , like periodontal related resection , to prevent the need for a separate surgical entry later . in a similar situation , when the impacted tooth is a maxillary third molar , root resection in adjacent strategically important tooth may aid in salvaging the remaining portion of the tooth to avoid distal extension .',\n",

       " {'article': \"malignant neoplasms arising primarily from the heart and large vessels are rare , and those arising from the pulmonary artery are even rarer . patients with pulmonary artery tumor are at increased risk of life - threatening events when they become symptomatic . major artery thromboembolism and acute right heart failure have been frequently observed in such patients . historically , pulmonary artery tumors were most often diagnosed at autopsy , but recent advances in imaging technology have allowed better antemortem diagnosis . precise pathodiagnosis of pulmonary artery tumors is difficult because of the necessity to obtain a tissue sample from this hard - to - access lesion . according to past reports , most tumors arising from pulmonary artery were sarcomas including various histologic types , such as undifferentiated sarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma . in addition , secondary involvements of pulmonary arteries by lung cancer and pulmonary tumoral embolism caused by various malignancies have been described . patients who were not suitable candidates for invasive surgery tended to have poor outcomes because effective alternative therapeutic methods , including systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy , were not well established . in the present report , a very rare case of undifferentiated malignant neoplasm of the pulmonary artery a 67-year - old japanese woman was admitted to the hospital with chief complaints of worsening dry cough and dyspnea on exertion of 1 month 's duration . she was noted to have an abnormality on chest x - ray and was referred to our hospital for further examination . contrast - enhanced chest computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a low - density tumor obstructing the left pulmonary artery ( fig . d ) and a pedunculated lesion extending to the main and right pulmonary arteries . a small part of the tumor also extended to the mediastinal space outside the pulmonary artery invading the left superior pulmonary vein , but there was no evidence of invasion of the trachea or bronchium . a fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) scan revealed a high uptake by the tumor of the pulmonary artery ( max . standardized uptake value 23.11 ) , multiple metastases in both lungs , bones ( right 4th and 11th ribs , right ischial bone ) and both adrenal glands ( fig . 2 ) . suspected primary lesions other than that in the pulmonary artery were not identified . tumor markers , including carcinoembryonic antigen , carbohydrate antigen ( ca ) 19 - 9 , cytokeratin 19 fragment ( cyfra ) , pro - gastrin - releasing peptide , ca15 - 3 , and ca125 , were within the normal limits . no abnormal findings in the gastrointestinal tracts , gynecologic organs , and breasts were detected . catheter angiography of the heart and pulmonary arteries revealed that blood flow to the left pulmonary artery was interrupted by the filling tumor and the fluttering pedunculated tumors extending from the main tumors into the trunk and right pulmonary arteries . small tumor samples could be obtained by catheter aspiration biopsy , but hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade occurred during the procedures , and drainage by pericardiocentesis and blood transfusion were urgently required . histopathological examination showed a colonization of atypical small round cells of irregular shapes , hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasms . tumor specimens were immunohistochemically positive for vimentin and partially positive for cytokeratin , but negative for s-100 protein , vascular endothelial markers [ e.g. , cluster of differentiation ( cd)31 , cd34 , von willebrand factor ] , myogenic markers ( e.g. , alpha - smooth muscle actin and muscle - specific actin , desmin ) , lymphocyte markers ( e.g. , cd45 , cd20 , cd79a , cd3 ) , and lung cancer markers ( e.g. , thyroid transcription factor-1 , surfactant protein a ) ( fig . the tumor was finally diagnosed as an undifferentiated malignant neoplasm arising from the pulmonary artery . anticoagulant therapy with warfarin was started for the prevention of thromboembolism as a result of tumor of the pulmonary artery , but the risk of sudden death due to thromboembolism remained high . surgical resection of the pulmonary artery tumor and replacement with an artificial vessel was not employed , because this highly invasive surgery might have compromised the patient 's general condition and because of the expected subsequent difficulties for further systemic therapy for the remaining metastatic lesions . since local control of the intrapulmonary artery tumor was thought to be the prime determinant of short - term prognosis , chemoradiotherapy consisting of irradiation ( 50 gy/25 fractions ) of the pulmonary artery tumor and concurrent systemic chemotherapy with paclitaxel ( 40 mg / m , administered on days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , and 36 ) and carboplatin ( area under the curve 2 , on the same days ) were performed . according to the common terminology , criteria for adverse events version 3.0 , grade 3 esophagitis , grade 2 thrombocytopenia , and grade 3 febrile neutropenia were observed , and chemotherapy was stopped on day 36 . thirty - five days after the initiation of chemoradiotherapy , pulmonary artery tumor size had markedly decreased , an improvement of the perfusion in the left lung was seen ( fig . the combination therapy of paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m , on day 1 , every 3 weeks ) and carboplatin ( area under the curve 5 , on day 1 , every 3 weeks ) was subsequently continued for 5 months without tumor progression . however , the patient died of bleeding from the right adrenal metastatic lesion 9 months after the initial diagnosis . tumors originating from the heart and large vessels are found at an incidence of about 0.02% at autopsy . tumors of the pulmonary artery are furthermore rare tumors ; in fact , only approximately 200 cases have been reported in the literature . since lethal events frequently occur in patients with pulmonary artery tumor when initial symptoms are present , 60% of these cases have previously been diagnosed by autopsy . more recently , advances in imaging technologies have allowed more successful antemortem diagnosis . to obtain sufficient tumor samples for histological diagnosis , open chest surgery under general anesthesia was required . performing the appropriate therapy based on a definitive diagnosis was often difficult for such patients who were not suitable candidates for surgery . tumor biopsy via intravenous catheterization has recently been used to obtain a small amount of tumor samples in such patients , as was done in the present case . most primary tumors of the pulmonary artery are sarcomas , including angiosarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , fibrosarcoma and unclassified undifferentiated sarcoma [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] . secondary / tertiary pulmonary artery tumors include those caused by direct invasion by lung cancer   and hematogenous metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma , renal cell carcinoma , breast cancer , and colorectal cancer . our patient had multiple tumor lesions in the bilateral lungs , bones , and adrenal glands . a diagnosis of primary pulmonary artery tumor was made , as that lesion was the largest and had the highest uptake of fdg compared to all the other lesions , which were more consistent with metastatic lesions . although a small part of the tumor located in the mediastinal region suggested the possibility of direct invasion by a tumor outside the pulmonary artery , based on the clinical findings the tumor was more likely to arise from the pulmonary artery . histopathological findings in the tumor tissue from the intrapulmonary artery tumor included undifferentiated small atypical cells . although immunohistochemical examination was intensively performed , it was difficult to identify the definitive origin of the tumor ; ultimately , the lesion was diagnosed as an undifferentiated malignant neoplasm of pulmonary artery . in terms of therapies , surgery has been associated with favorable survival outcomes in a study of the primary pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma without distant metastasis . while overall survival of the patients treated without surgical operation was 11  3 months , that of the patients treated with surgical operation was 36.5  20.2 months , and cases of long - term survival were observed . therefore , surgical resection of the pulmonary artery tumor in appropriate surgical candidates might be effective in reducing the risk of sudden death . radiation therapy has also had mild antitumor effects and produced symptom relief in patients with these lesions who were not candidates for surgery . chemotherapies with doxorubicin - based regimens for sarcomas of the pulmonary artery have been utilized , but without objective response . specific regimens for pulmonary artery sarcoma have not been established , because no regimen has produced significant responses or benefits in terms of outcomes . cases of pulmonary artery tumor with metastasis were generally associated with poor outcomes with a median survival period of several months . since our patient had undifferentiated malignant neoplasm obstructing the left pulmonary artery with multiple metastases , the therapeutic strategy should first provide local control , and any survival benefit likely requires good continuity of therapy . in most cases of chemotherapy for undifferentiated tumors arising from various organs , regimens for the differentiated tumor type of the corresponding organs are often employed . however , no effective chemotherapy has been reported for undifferentiated neoplasm of the pulmonary artery with distant metastasis , mostly because these cases are very rare . we selected combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin , referring to the regimens for carcinoma of unknown primary site . concurrent radiotherapy for the primary tumor was also performed based on the information from chemoradiotherapy regimens used against non - small cell lung cancer . this therapy could achieve a significant reduction in the size of the tumors as well as symptomatic relief and long - term survival . in the present case , the patient 's direct cause of death was hemorrhage from the right adrenal metastasis 9 months after the initial chemoradiotherapy , but no fatal events in conjunction with pulmonary arterial tumor were observed . we conclude that chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel might be of benefit for patients with undifferentiated malignant neoplasm of the pulmonary artery who are not suitable candidates for surgery . since this is a single instance of treatment of this disease , additional cases need to be collected , the use of multidisciplinary therapy needs to be assessed , and further biological analyses of undifferentiated neoplasm arising from the pulmonary artery need to be conducted .\",\n",

documented that at least 60% of embryos generated by various laboratory procedures used in conventional in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) protocols are chromosomally incompetent . the errors leading to numerical abnormalities in these embryos are responsible for the current success rates in art . we herewith present a case report where the use of this technique resulted in a successful viable twin birth . the patient was a 28-year - old when she first sought consultation with us in january 2012 , after 1 year and 4 months of marriage . she had married her cousin ( iii consanguinity ) and had regular menstrual cycles but infrequent intercourse owing to vaginismus . her husband 's semen parameters were normal and her hormonal evaluation revealed a high day 2 luteinizing hormone ( lh ) value ( > 8 ) in consecutive cycles . a diagnostic hysterolaparoscopy was performed which revealed a posterior wall fibroid ( < 2 cm ) patent tubes and normal appearing ovaries . she underwent a fenton 's repair in the same sitting and was allowed a period of 6 months to conceive using mild ovarian stimulation with clomiphene and timed intercourse . her hormonal evaluation was done and found to be normal except for a high lh . she was initiated for the long protocol in may 2013 , using injection zoladex 3.6 mg subcutaneously on day 20 ( astrazeneca , london , uk ) for downregulation and gonal - f ( merck serono , india ) with luveris ( merck serono , india ) for ovarian hyperstimulation . nineteen oocytes were obtained of which 11 fertilized and 9 embryos were viable for transfer and freezing . five embryos were frozen , whereas 4 were used for sequential transfer , 2 ( 68 cells ) grade ii on day 3 , and one expanded blastocyst ( iii ) on day 5 . she conceived in this cycle , but it resulted in a preclinical pregnancy . a menstrual regulation was performed in june 2013 . the couple went on a break until august 2013 when they returned for the frozen embryo transfer ( fet ) . she was placed on hormone replacement therapy and had a fet performed on october 7 , 2013 . the chorionic villi obtained by dilatation and curettage were sent for karyotyping , and it revealed trisomy . the cytogeneticist revealed the karyotype of the husband to be normal male with pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 ( 46 , xy , inv ( 9 ) ( p11q13 ) ) . although found in 11.65% of the population , it has been associated with spermatogenic disturbances in men with infertility by the presence of loops or acentric fragments formed during meiosis . this time , they were counseled regarding pgs of embryos along with their conventional art program , and they gave their consent for the same . in march 2014 , she was once again initiated with the long protocol , using injection zoladex ( astrazeneca , london , uk ) for downregulation and recagon ( organon india pvt . ltd . , india ) and human menopausal gonadotropins ( lg life sciences , india ) for ovarian hyperstimulation . we retrieved 22 oocytes by transvaginal aspiration , of which 17 were fertilized using intracytoplasmic sperm injection . fifteen embryos cleaved of which we performed biopsy on 10 of them , which were at least 68 cells or more in cleavage stage on day 3 . out of 10 biopsied embryos [ figures 1 and 2 ] , 5 were normal embryos , 2 were complex abnormal , 1 was an abnormal embryo ( 7 , 9 ) , and 2 had no dna detected in them . only 2 of the 5 normal embryos developed into hatching blastocysts while the rest were arrested . no blastocysts were generated from the remaining biopsied embryos with a blastocyst formation rate of only 20% . the two normal blastocysts [ figures 3 and 4 ] were transferred to the patient on day 5 . her serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin done on the 11 day and 13 day was 427.9 miu / ml and 791.6 miu / ml , respectively . an ultrasound on 38 day revealed a twin intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart pulsations . she had a prophylactic cervical cerclage on june 30 , 2014 , at 1415 weeks of pregnancy . her level ii antenatal screening at 22 weeks was normal and her antenatal period was also uneventful . she delivered a healthy male and female baby weighing 2.19 kg and 2.26 kg , respectively [ figure 5 ] . we have been performing biopsies since october 2013 for pgs and were very restricted to offering it for patients , selecting only those with repeated failures in art or those with karyotype variations or abnormalities . however , this year , we extended to all affordable patients who would benefit within the first attempt itself to a greater extent than conventional art . since then , we have done 75 cases where 740 embryos were generated . of these the most common errors were complex abnormalities ( multiple chromosomal errors were detected in a single embryo ) . the subsequent miscarriage rate and take home baby rates posttransfer of normal blasts were 26.6% and 73.4% , respectively . more so , it is important to recognize that abnormal embryos do have a blastocyst conversion rate as follows , 40% for trisomy , 21% for polyploidy , and 0% for haploid / monosomic . it is also interesting to note that aneuploidies during the cleavage stage affect the chromosomes 15 , 16 , 21 , and 22 the most and x or y the least . trisomic and monosomic ( aneuploid ) embryos account for at least 10% of pregnancies and for women at advanced age , the incidence may exceed 50% . it becomes imperative to detect these in cases of assisted reproduction when performed for women in older age group who wish to try their own gametes . there is a degree of mosaicism ( 90% normal and 10% abnormal ) , one can expect in embryos which hamper the efficacy and accuracy of pgs . when a report is normal , it means that all nuclei are normal except for 10% which may be tetraploidy . qi et al . reported that 15.6% of blastocyst and embryos biopsied from women with advanced age group were euploid , whereas 84.4% were aneuploid . we are associated with two different laboratories that provide us with array comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) and next -

a myomectomy was performed rather than hysterectomy in order to preserve fertility . her medical history also included an appendectomy at the age of 15 following histological findings of a carcinoid . complete blood count analysis , urea , creatinine , electrolytes , antinuclear antibodies , anti - dna , c3 and c4 complement as well as the results of liver function tests and chest radiography were normal . histopathological examination showed a proliferation of smooth muscle bundles intermingled with varying amounts of collagen fibers and a few lymphocyte infiltrates ( fig . pelvic ultrasonography and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging were performed which revealed uterine fibroids ( fig . our patient finally underwent a hysterectomy , and the subsequent biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma . a diagnosis of multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis , typical for rs , was established . clinically , they occur as small , smooth - surfaced , skin - colored or pinkish - brown , solitary and/or multiple papules or nodules that range from 0.2 to 2.0 cm in diameter . cutaneous leiomyomas are divided into three categories : piloleiomyomas arising from the arrector pili muscle of the hair follicle , genital leiomyomas emerging from the tunica dartos of the scrotum and the mammary muscles of the nipples , and angioleiomyomas originating from vascular smooth muscle [ 4 , 5 ] . the extremities are the most frequently involved sites , particularly the extensor surfaces , followed by the trunk , face and neck . more than one area of the body can be involved in the majority of these patients , and the lesions develop in adolescence or late adulthood [ 3 , 4 ] . piloleiomyoma is the most common type of cutaneous leiomyoma , usually occurring in early adult life . the majority of them are tender or painful , the pain often being described as burning , pinching or stabbing [ 5 , 6 ] . pain or tenderness may be spontaneous or induced by cold , stress , touch , trauma or pressure . many authors support the idea that pain or tenderness may be secondary to pressure on nerve fibers within the tumor , whereas others suggest that they could be due solely to contraction of muscle fibers . histopathology demonstrates smooth muscle fiber bundles with varying degrees of intermingled collagen in the dermis [ 5 , 7 , 8 ] . the smooth muscle fibers are composed of eosinophilic cytoplasm with elongated blunt - ended nuclei with little or no waviness . severe inflammation , significant cytologic atypia , necrosis or encapsulation are not apparent . if necessary , desmin , smooth muscle actin and muscle - specific actin may highlight the smooth muscle origin of the tumor . the predisposition to rs has been localized to the chromosome 1q42.3q43 [ 9 , 10 ] in the gene encoding fumarate hydratase ( fh ) . fh converts fumarate to malate in the krebs cycle , and is also thought to act as a suppressor of tumor genes [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . association of this syndrome with renal cell carcinoma has recently been highlighted [ 13 , 14 ] . the syndrome of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma also results from a germline mutation in the gene encoding fh [ 11 , 12 ] . the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in people with fh mutation , though unclear , seems to be lower than that documented for uterine and cutaneous leiomyomatosis . renal cell carcinoma associated with rs occurs in the third to fourth decade of life and histopathologically demonstrates cysts of papillary cell carcinoma . the possibility of an association between carcinoids , which are benign tumors , and rs has not yet been considered in the literature , but warrants investigation . toro et al .   reported that patients with rs developed cutaneous lesions at a statistically significantly ( p = 0.048 ) earlier mean age ( 25 years ) in comparison with the mean age at diagnosis of uterine leiomyomas ( 30 years ) . in our case , the onset of cutaneous leiomyomas began after puberty , at the age of 14 . according to a study of a large case series conducted by alam et al . , the mean age of onset is 24.1 years ( median 25 years , range 9 45 years ) , while in a minority of female patients , the onset correlated with hormonal change , such as puberty , pregnancy , a contraceptive regimen or other hormonal medication . kim   reported a case of skin lesions appearing in a 51-year - old woman after the initiation of estrogen replacement therapy following an oophorectomy for ovarian cysts . in our case , the patient was diagnosed with fibroids at 28 years of age ; she experienced several gynecological symptoms and underwent a myomectomy . she had been misdiagnosed for several years before being admitted to our department at 38 years of age where she was diagnosed as having rs . the treatment of cutaneous leiomyomas depends on the number of lesions and the presence or absence of symptoms . medications such as oral nitroglycerin , nifedipine , doxazosin and phenoxybenzamine , which block smooth muscle contraction , and medications that target nerve activity , such as gabapentin and topical analgesics that have been used to treat symptomatic leiomyomas , have shown limited effectiveness [ 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] . when few lesions are present , surgical excision with skin grafting can be considered . recurrences have been reported to occur from 6 weeks to more than 15 years after excision . notably , a recent report by christenson et al .   described carbon dioxide laser ablation as an effective treatment for multiple cutaneous leiomyomas complete disappearance of pain symptoms 9 months after its application . although rs is quite rare , dermatologists should bear it in mind in patients with multiple leiomyomas because of the risk of severe uterine fibroids and in some cases aggressive renal cancer [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] . even though cutaneous leiomyomas are benign tumors , women affected by this condition can develop uterine fibroids with pain , menorrhagia and infertility .\",\n",

       " {'article': 'currently , 60% of small bowel obstructions are accounted for by adhesions with a great increase in elective abdominal surgery from the late 20th century . the remaining causes include hernias 15% , neoplasms 6% , inflammatory causes 5% , mesenteric vascular occlusions 5% , intussusception 3% , and unusual etiology such as foreign bodies 6% . on the other hand , since first described in 1897 , radiation is well known to have toxic gastrointestinal effects . among them , stricture formation is recognized as one of the complications of chronic radiation enteritis . it is easily conceivable that intestinal narrowing can be a contributing factor to the obstruction by foreign bodies . here , we present a case of a 73-year - old woman who presented with small bowel obstruction 23 years after pelvic irradiation for uterine cancer . it was the stricture caused by fibrosis of the bowel wall that prevented the accidentally swallowed small ume stone from passing through the irradiated ileum . a 73-year - old woman , who had undergone total hysterectomy and pelvic radiation therapy with a total dose of 50 gy for uterine cancer 23 years earlier , was hospitalized for nausea and abdominal fullness . she had other past history including iliac artery occlusion presumably due to radiation and rheumatoid arthritis which had been treated with 5 mg of predonisolone per day for 23 years . on examination temperature was 36.9c , pulse 66 beats / min , and blood pressure 120/58 mm hg . laboratory studies revealed a high white blood cell count of 11,500/mm and a low albumin level of 2.5 mg / dl . ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a nut shell - like high - density structure in the small bowel ( fig . the patient said that she had accidentally swallowed a kernel of ume ( japanese apricot ) a few days prior to the onset of the symptom . she was subjected to surgery with a diagnosis of food - induced intestinal obstruction . at laparotomy , we found impaction of a solid stone ( 13  18 mm ) causing perforation of the sclerosed ileum with a whitish appearance , 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve ( fig . the resected ileum showed severe luminal stenosis and had two mucosal ulcerations corresponding to the protrusions of the ume seed , one of which resulted in a pin - hole perforation ( fig . histopathologic examination of the resected ileum with stricture ( 10 cm distal to the perforation area ) showed fibrosis of the lamina propria ( fig . figure 3b shows severe inflammation and mucosal ulceration of the perforation area 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve . it is considered that radiation - induced fibrosis reduced the compliance of the ileal wall , which prevented passage of the small ume stone . radiation enteritis generally affects the distal ileum , sigmoid colon and rectum   because the pelvic region is the most frequent target of radiotherapy for tumors such as gynecologic cancer . in the acute phase , radiation mainly affects the intestinal epithelium   and induces edema , hyperemia and ulceration , leading to severe diarrhea . in contrast , chronic radiation damage is caused by progressive endarteritis obliterans involving the submucosal and serosal layers , followed by segmental ischemia of the bowel wall and replacement by hyaline fibrous tissue that often results in obstructive symptoms . the incidence of chronic radiation enteritis depends on the size of the irradiated field and the total dose . it has been reported that clinical manifestations of chronic injury to the intestine occurred in 20 to 30% of cases treated with 50 to 60 gy and one third or more of those treated with more than 60 gy . our patient received 50 gy to the whole pelvis , a typical dose for uterine carcinoma . our patient experienced no gastrointestinal symptoms for 23 years after irradiation , although she developed iliac artery stenosis possibly caused by the same mechanisms . in our case , the rigid wall and stricture formation as well as histological findings in the terminal ileum were compatible with chronic changes after irradiation . the accidentally swallowed ume stone became stuck in the stricture in the ileum , causing ulceration and finally perforation . a literature search revealed numerous reports about phytobezoars , which are the common cause of food - induced obstruction , but none made mention of an association with radiation enteritis . however , there are 5 case reports of food - induced small bowel obstruction with radiation enteritis in the japanese literature . pickled ume , a traditional japanese food often served with rice as a relish , is especially eaten by the japanese elderly . the size of the seeds ranges from approximately 0.8 to 2 cm in diameter , which usually pass through the whole bowel even when swallowed . however , our case suggests that the low compliance caused by pathological changes did not allow the ingested ume stone to pass through the irradiated ileum . complications of chronic radiation enteritis present a significant clinical problem because of technical difficulties in surgical treatment . therefore , in cases with obstruction , conservative treatment consisting of intravenous fluids and nasogastric tube decompression is generally recommended at first . however , resection of ischemic and fibrotic bowel is necessary for patients like our case with food impaction . it is controversial whether bowel reconstruction should be performed at the same time or whether judicious stoma formation should be performed to avoid anastomosis leakage , since wound healing is considered to be impaired in irradiated bowel . suggested the advantage of treatment of terminal ileal lesions by right hemicolectomy and ileo - transverse anastomosis . in fact , in patients with pelvic radiotherapy , the ascending , transverse and descending colon are usually free from radiation and are preferable sites for anastomosis . nowadays , resection with primary anastomosis is generally favored if anastomosis can be performed in uninvolved intestine . in our case , we selected ileo - cecal resection , and anastomotic leakage did not occur despite malnutrition and the regular use of steroids . in conclusion , when elderly with a past history of pelvic radiation therapy present with small bowel obstruction , the possible influence of late radiation injury to the intestine should be considered . the patient should be carefully interviewed about ingested material because even small objects can become stuck in a stricture in the ileum . when surgical management is required , anastomosis should be performed in bowel free of radiation injury .',\n",

       " {'article': 'phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an inborn error of metabolism , characterized by mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) gene . loss of pah activity results in increased concentrations of phenylalanine ( phe ) in the blood and toxic concentrations in the brain . pku is the most frequent inborn error of amino acid metabolism with a prevalence that varies widely around the world . in latin america , its prevalence varies between one case per 50.000 and one per 25.000 with a higher prevalence in southern latin america . when left untreated , pku is the most common cause of mental retardation , with patients presenting progressive intellectual impairment , accompanied by a constellation of additional symptoms , which can include eczematous rash , autism , seizures , and motor deficits . developmental disturbances , aberrant behavior , and psychiatric symptoms often become apparent as the child grows . however , since the widespread introduction of newborn screening and dietary phe restriction , the outcome of this disorder has dramatically changed . an early diagnosis and prompt intervention with its dietary restriction , which remains the mainstay of pku management , allows most individuals to avoid severe mental disability . during infancy , adherence to the diet is straightforward because the parents take control of their nutritional intake . as the children grow older , their adherence to treatment becomes increasingly difficult because meals have to be planned rigorously and the children can not choose the food routinely consumed by their peers . consequently , compliance with the diet is often poor , especially when the patients reach adolescence . due to those inconsistencies , little non - adherence to treatment and persistent exposure to high levels of phe among these older patients , result in impairments of brain function characterized by deficits in executive functioning , processing speed and fine motor control . herein we present the clinical and neuroradiological aspects of an adolescent patient , who despite all difficulties , followed successfully a lifelong restrictive dietotherapy for pku a 19-year - old young girl born to non - consanguineous parents , with an uneventful gestational history , who was born at term by normal delivery , was diagnosed with pku on routine neonatal screening test and started dietotherapy at the age of 20-days - old . the diagnosis was confirmed through molecular analysis of the patient as well as the parents . genetic analysis showed that she is compound heterozygous for the following mutations : p.l249f and p.r261q . she maintained constant control of phe levels with its dosage every 15 days on the first two years of life , followed by phe restriction with routine measurements in accordance to clinical guidelines . her laboratory levels of phe were kept under 26 mg / dl since 20 days - of - age . at present , the patient is a college undergraduate student , with normal educational achievements . a neuropsychological evaluation was performed with results compatible to her age and schooling . upon neurological examination , she presents a slightly brisk patellar reflex , without any other pyramidal signs or other abnormalities . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain shows bilateral and symmetrical signs of demyelination ( figure 1 ) . \\n figure 1axial flair mri images ( a and b ) show symmetrical hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter , internal capsules and corpus callosum . the diffusion tensor imaging ( c ) shows signs of restriction , confirmed in the apparent diffusion coefficient map ( d ) . \\n  axial flair mri images ( a and b ) show symmetrical hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter , internal capsules and corpus callosum . the diffusion tensor imaging ( c ) shows signs of restriction , confirmed in the apparent diffusion coefficient map ( d ) . the hospital s ethic commission approved this case report and the parents gave informed consent for publication . pku is one of the most important examples of successful treatment of an inborn error of metabolism . since the adoption of widespread newborn screening , allowing an early diagnosis and the institution of the dietary treatment , the quality of life and the prognosis of the patients with pku has dramatically changed . many adolescents and adults are unable to fully adhere to the phe restricted diet for the long term . as many as 75% of teenagers and probably an even greater fraction of adults have blood phe levels above the desired range . many of these patients exhibit increasing non - compliance over time , eventually leading them to abandon treatment altogether . despite all these difficulties , our patient succeeded in maintaining a lifelong dietary treatment for pku , with complete adherence over the years . unfortunately , even for this small fraction of individuals , there is a growing body of evidence that they are not doing so well . from the neuroradiological point of view , in spite of frequently normal mri findings among well treated pku patients , conventional mri revealed morphological abnormalities within their cerebral white matter , predominantly in the peritrigonal region , but less frequently also in the anterior and posterior periventricular regions with involvement of the subcortical white matter . additionaly , the prevalence of these white matter abnormalities tends to be higher and more severe among older patients , those who are off - treatment and those with high - phe levels . the adequate compliance to treatment and the phe levels is thought to be of fundamental importance to the occurrence of these white matter abnormalities . , abnormalities of the white matter in pku treated patients are more common on those who have discontinued the low - phe diet during adolescence , with improvement among those who have resumed their treatment , indicating that the white matter appearance reflects the elevated blood phe levels . even in patients who underwent early and continuous treatment for pku , as in ours her white matter abnormalities were mostly found in regions adjacent to the lateral ventricles with diffusivity restriction on diffusion tension imaging ( dti ) sequence . mri studies among early treated show typical abnormalities in regions adjacent to the lateral ventricles , as well as in the parieto - occipital white matter and genu of the corpus callosum . in the past , the importance of these abnormalities was understated due to the lack of association with clinical outcomes . more recently , however , researches have revealed relationships between white matter abnormalities , clinical outcomes and cognition . according to brumm et al . in spite of early dietary treatment and normal iq , adults with pku show deficits in cognitive functioning . those deficits include a performance well below expectation on verbal learning and memory tasks , as well as other areas of cognitive weakness such as visual memory , expressive naming and selective executive skills . using dti , white et al . identified an age - related decrement in the microstructural integrity of the anterior white matter of the corpus callosum in children with early - and continuously - treated pku . they demonstrated a mean diffusivity abnormality within anterior regions of the corpus callosum that became increasingly pronounced with age . this restriction was hypothesized to be the result of the accumulation of intracellular debris produced as a byproduct of inadequate phe metabolism . this , in turn , could lead to the cognitive symptoms , since white matter permits interactions among brain regions that sub serve various cognitive abilities . further research is needed to determine whether white matter hyperintensities , and compromises in their microstructural integrity are interrelated to pku and whether these abnormalities might be related to other factors such as the physiological mechanisms underlying dopamine deficiency . it is important to note that , to date , investigations regarding the biochemical markers associated with executive function ( ef ) impairment among children with early and continuously treated pku remain largely pheonly focused , with little attention paid to other substances of the phe pathway such as tyrosine ( tyr ) . disturbances arising from the biochemistry point - of - view associated with pku are thought to primarily affect the dopaminergic systems in the brain due to the disruption of the metabolism of phe to tyr , a precursor of dopamine . a high phe : tyr ratio is hypothesized to lead to a reduction in dopamine synthesis within the brain , which may better explain ef deficits among children with pku than phe levels alone . this may be the reason why individuals with early and continuously treated pku continue to show high levels of ef impairment . our patient was under strict control of phe levels over her entire life , but only a single dosage of tyr was performed during her childhood . this data could establish new managing and monitoring practices with continuous tyr monitoring along with not only phe restriction but also tyr reposition to pku patients . we reported on a case of an adolescent girl with successful early and continuous treatment for pku , who despite her efforts presents striking white matter abnormalities . we also reviewed current literature in order to explain these abnormalities , which finally pose the question : is phenylalanine restriction solely enough ?',\n",

tubercular treatment empirically based on features of recurrent intestinal obstruction at other medical centers on the pretext of the prevalence of tuberculosis in this region . abdominal examination showed distension in the epigastric and umbilical regions with localized tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds . contrast enhanced computed tomography was , therefore , not performed but erect and supine abdominal radiograpghs revealed multiple air fluid levels ( figure 1a ) and dilated jejunal loops ( figure 1b ) , respectively . a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction was made after which an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed . this revealed multiple inflamed diverticulae ( figure 2 ) in the jejunum with a band 15 cm from ligament of treitz . the largest diverticulum was 5x4x4 cm at the mesentric border ( figure 3 ) with multiple adhesions ( figure 4 ) in jejunum and proximal ileum forming a blind loop . pin -

operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 10 after surgery . the histopathological examination of the specimen showed focal mucosal ulceration with sub - mucosal edema and chronic inflammatory infiltrate , whereas multiple sections taken from diverticulae exhibited features of diverticulitis along with an area of stricture . jejunal diverticulum is an acquired condition first described in 1974 by sommerings and later by astley cooler . it is a false diverticulum ( in contrast to meckel s diverticulum ) characterized by herniation of only mucosa and submucosa , and lacks a muscularis propria . the incidence of small bowel diverticulosis is very low compared to colonic diverticulosis that is found in 15 - 40% of adults over 40 years of age . the patient presents with chronic abdominal discomfort , dyspepsia with vague abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting . complications occur in 15% of cases and include inflammation , obstruction ( dynamic / adynamic ) , perforation and hemorrhage . adynamic intestinal obstruction is most common with jejunal diverticulosis occurring as a result of peritonitis , perforations , strangulation or incarceration of enterolith . whereas dynamic intestinal obstruction occurs only in 2.3 - 4.6% of cases and may arise as enterolith formation , intussusception and volvulus , adhesive band formation occurs as a result of previous diverticulitis . there are very few cases reported in literature of jejunal diverticulosis presenting as a case of intestinal obstruction due to adhesions and band formations . in 2009 , nejmeddine et al . reported a case of jejunal diverticulum with acute intestinal obstruction caused as a result of band formation . in 2005 , lin et al . reported strangulation due to mesodiverticular band formation in 1999 , lobo et al . reported dynamic intestinal obstruction as the most frequent complication of jejunal diverticulum . in 2008 , balducci et al . diagnostic evaluation includes plain abdominal x -

diagnostic approaches such as physical abdominal examination , abdominal radiograph and barium meal follow through to assess the patient for possible complications . as soon as this is confirmed , a decision to proceed to immediate laparotomy needs to be made for diverticular resection and surgical removal of bands and adhesions to prevent further complications that could lead to internal hemorrhage , perforation , intestinal obstruction , strangulation , enterolith formation and pus exudation .',\n",

old female presenting for care at 34 weeks of gestation with acute pulmonary embolism treated initially with unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) and low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , who developed hit . to the best of our knowledge , this is one of the first case reports describing a successful use of fondaparinux in the treatment of hit in a third - trimester pregnant woman , providing a novel approach for this subset of patients . during pregnancy and the postpartum period , women are 4 times more likely to suffer from venous thromboembolism ( vte ) than if they are not pregnant . the incidence of pulmonary embolism ( pe ) during pregnancy ranges between 0.3 and 1 per 1000 deliveries , and pe is a leading cause of the maternal mortality in developed countries . heparin- induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) is an immune - mediated disorder caused by the development of antibodies to a complex of platelet factor 4 ( pf4 ) and heparin . hit antibodies of igg class bind to a multimolecular complex of pf4 and heparin on platelet surfaces , resulting in platelet activation . we present a case of a pregnant patient with acute pe treated initially with unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) and low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , who developed hit . a 24-year - old female ( gravida 1 , para 1 ) at 34 weeks of gestation was referred from another hospital to the intensive care unit due to acute pe . one month before the hospitalization , the patient was prescribed bed - rest due to threatened premature labour transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dysfunction  enlarged right ventricle ( 33 mm ) , paradoxical movement of the intraventricular septum , mcconnell sign , shortened acceleration time ( 50 ms ) and a transtricuspid pressure gradient value of 30 mmhg . moreover , saddle pulmonary embolus was revealed ( figure 1 ) . on admission to the intensive care unit , she was moderately dyspneic , with preserved systemic blood pressure ( 110/70 mmhg ) and moderate tachycardia 98/min . d - dimer plasma level was 5226 g / ml ( normal values < 500 g / ml , vidas bio - merieux ) , while plasma cardiac troponin level and renal and hepatic functions were normal . therefore , a diagnosis of intermediate - risk acute pe was made . initially , for 4 days the patient was treated with aptt adjusted intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) followed by a 2-day treatment with enoxaparin in a dose of 1 mg / kg . the initial platelet count was 20010/l . platelet count was monitored every other day during the first days of therapy and always exceeded 10010/l . however , on the seventh day of anticoagulation therapy , a rapid decline in the platelet count , reaching 4410/l , was observed . the following causes of thrombocytopenia in our pregnant patient were considered : heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ttp ) , disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) , preeclampsia - eclampsia and hellp syndrome . hit was diagnosed on the basis of antiplatelet - heparin binding antibodies presence in serum ( gti diagnostics pf4 enhanced solid phase elisa ) , while other causes were excluded . treatment with subcutaneous fondaparinux injections in a daily dose of 7.5 mg was commenced . over the next few days , the platelet count decreased further , with a nadir of 1910/l . however , after 10 days the platelet count started to increase progressively ( figure 2 ) . no recurrence of venous thromboembolism or bleeding occurred . at 37 weeks of gestation , 24 hours before an elective caesarean delivery , fondaparinux injections were discontinued . at that time , platelet count was 20010/l and no signs of right ventricular dysfunction were present on echocardiography . the patient successfully underwent an elective caesarean section under general anesthesia and a healthy female newborn weighting 2620 g was delivered . the newborn suffered from no complications and had a normal platelet count ( 201 to 31310l ) . on the first postoperative day , one day later , the first dose of warfarin was administered and fondaparinux was discontinued 8 days later when a therapeutic inr was maintained between 2 and 3 . both mother and baby were discharged home in good general condition on the 10 day after delivery . vte in pregnancy is an important cause of maternal morbidity , and acute pe still remains the major cause of maternal mortality in the developed countries . the treatment of acute pe in pregnancy routinely relies on the use of lmwh or ufh . on admission to the hospital , according to the recent esc guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism , our patient suffered from intermediate - risk pe ( with a reported short - term mortality of 315% ) . anticoagulation with intravenous ufh was initiated , due mainly to fear of possible hemodynamic deterioration , which might have then required thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy . after 7 days of heparin therapy , the platelet count rapidly decreased from an initial value of 20010/l to 4410/l , and hit was suspected . currently , hit is diagnosed by the combination of clinical observations and laboratory results . according to the 8th accp guidelines on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy , diagnosis of hit should be made when any of the following events occur in association with the presence of  hit antibodies  detected by in vitro assays : an otherwise unexplained platelet count fall of 50% , venous or arterial thrombosis , skin lesions at heparin injection sites , or acute systemic ( anaphylactoid ) reaction , that occur after iv heparin bolus administration . pf4 enhanced enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay confirmed hit antibodies in the studied patient . it should be noted that we did not perform ( 14)c - serotonin - release assay , which is regarded for reference method in hit diagnosis . this test is not widely used in routine clinical practise and was unavailable in our department . previous studies have shown that the risk of hit is lower with lmwh than with ufh , which is more immunogenic , and this condition is extremely rare in pregnant patients . only 1 possible case of hit was observed among 1167 pregnancies treated with lmwh in 3 studies [ 810 ] . moreover , greer and nielson - piercy reported no hit cases among 2777 pregnancies in which lmwh was administered . although patients with hit can have significantly decreased platelet counts , they still require anticoagulation with an effective antithrombotic agent that does not cross - react in vivo with the circulating anti - heparin / pf4 antibodies . moreover , administration of drug therapy during pregnancy should be very careful to minimise fetal risks . an alternative non - heparin anticoagulant that may be used during pregnancy is danaparoid , which does not appear to cross the placenta [ 1214 ] . we did nt use danaparoid because this drug was not available in our hospital and it was impossible to use it quickly . mehta et al described a case of hit at 7 weeks gestation managed with lepirudin . young et al described a pregnant woman with portal vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia treated with argatroban for suspected hit during the third trimester , but there exists only limited human data describing use of this agent during pregnancy . fondaparinux offers practical advantages over direct thrombin inhibitors , including once - daily subcutaneous administration , and has no requirement for laboratory monitoring . however , 1 study found that approximately 10% of the maternal plasma concentration of fondaparinux could be detected in the cord blood of a newborn . dempfle et al . found transplacental passage of fondaparinux in 5 women , who were treated because of heparin allergy , although this concentration was well below that required for effective anticoagulation , and no adverse effects were noted in the newborns . furthermore , lagrange et al observed no transplacental passage of fondaparinux in an in vitro study . finally , mazollai et al suggest that fondaparinux is a safe and effective treatment in pregnant patients . importantly , fondaparinux does not cross - react in vivo with the circulating anti - heparin / pf4 antibodies , although 1 non - pregnant patient treated with fondaparinux is reported to have developed hit antibodies in the absence of heparin administration . since transplacental passage of fondaparinux can not be excluded , it was decided to perform an elective caesarean delivery in order to minimise the risk of bleeding complications in the newborn during delivery ( i.e. , intracranial hemorrhage ) . moreover , the patient was scheduled for an elective caesarean section because she was diagnosed earlier with threatened preterm labour and had recurrent contractions causing shortening of the cervix . there was considerable concern that it would be necessary to perform an urgent caesarean section without prior discontinuation of fondaparinux , with high risk of bleeding during the surgery . therefore it was decided to perform an elective caesarean section after the 37 week of gestation . we decided to use general anaesthesia due to lack of experience with fondaparinux and regional anesthesia with the possibility of bleeding complications after neuraxial analgesia . the half - life of fondaparinux is 1721 h , which means that catheter placement would be possible at least 40 hours ( three elimination half - lives ) after the last dose of fondaparinux . we believe fondaparinux to be the anticoagulant of choice in rare cases of hit during the antepartum period . to the best of our knowledge , this is one of the first case reports describing the successful use of fondaparinux in the treatment of hit in a third - trimester pregnant woman , providing a novel approach for this subset of patients .',\n",

normal range , 48 to 195 mol / l ) . screening for inherited metabolic disorder by tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) revealed plasma ornithine levels of 380 mol / l ( cutoff , 290 mol / l ) . the younger twin 's bcva was 20 / 25 in the right eye and 20 / 32 in the left eye . the refractive error was -17.0 d in the right eye and -16.0 d in the left eye . her fundoscopy , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography , goldmann perimetry and full - field electroretinogram findings were similar to those of her older twin . accordingly , her plasma levels of ornithine on amino acids analysis and ms / ms were 831 mol / l and 424 mol / l , respectively . the clinical diagnosis of both patients was consistent with oat deficiency and ga of the choroid and retina . oat gene analysis resulted in the detection of two mutations in both patients : c.425g > a , a known mutation , and c.199 + 11_199 + 16dupaattaa , a previously unclassified mutation . both patients were treated with vitamin b6 ( pyridoxine ) 300 mg daily and an arginine - restricted diet . after three months of treatment , plasma ornithine levels as measured by ms / ms were 254 mol / l in the older twin and 365 mol / l in the younger twin . their visual acuities in each eye were preserved with no progression of chorioretinal atrophy on fundoscopy after 15 months , and the plasma ornithine levels were controlled at 386 mol / l and 408 mol / l , respectively . the fundus in patients with ga exhibits circular , well demarcated chorioretinal atrophy with hyperpigmented margins in the midperiphery . usually the fundus finding of scalloped chorioretinal atrophy in the midperiphery is sufficiently characteristic to determine ga . advanced choroideremia with generalized atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris may be confused . choroideremia is an x - linked disorder and the macula may be involved earlier than ga . the other differential diagnosis includes diffuse choriocapillaris atrophy , generalized choroidal dystrophy and central areolar choroidal dystrophy . ga is a genetic disorder caused by oat deficiency that results in markedly elevated levels of ornithine in plasma and other body fluids . the exact mechanism of chorioretinal atrophy due to hyperornithinemia is not known , although a low - arginine diet and vitamin b6 supplementation may decrease plasma ornithine levels and reduce the progression of ga . however , the long - term effects of this treatment approach have not been completely evaluated . more than 60 different mutations in the oat gene locus have been identified [ 2 - 4 ] . in this report genomic dna was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of both patients by using the wizard genomic dna purification kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) . all exons of the oat gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) on a thermal cycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) with primer pairs designed by the authors . direct sequencing was performed with the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit on an abi prism 3130 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems ) . the sequences were analyzed using the sequencher program ( gene codes corp . , ann arbor , mi , usa ) and were compared to the reference sequences . the numbering of nucleotide positions was done according to the acadm cdna sequence , and the genbank accession number was nm 000274.3 . sequence variation was described according to the recommendations of the human genome variation society ( http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen ) . these were c.425g > a , a known mutation , as well as c.199 + 11_199 + 16dup aattaa , a previously unclassified mutation . further evaluation including a large controlled study or family study is necessary to confirm whether c.199 + 11_199 + 16dupaattaa is an actual mutation rather than a polymorphism . reverse transcriptase pcr ( rt - pcr ) analysis may be helpful in clarifying this issue ; however , the likelihood that c.199 + 11_199 + 16dupaattaa is a mutation is quite high considering the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of the oat gene . patients with ga generally present with decreased night vision and high myopia during their adolescence , and early diagnosis in these patients allows for early treatment . indeed , oat gene studies in children with a high degree of myopia , especially in cases in which there is a complaint of nyctalopia , would be helpful for early identification . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of ga in the korean population diagnosed by oat genetic analysis and treated with vitamin b6 dietary supplementation .\",\n",

tie presents as partial ankyloglossia from tongue tip to the base of tongue with variable degrees classified by kotlow s and classification of ankyloglossia based on the degree of limitation of lingual mobility due to the hypertrophic lingual frenulum . an 8-year - old boy reported to the department of pedodontics and preventive dentistry , faculty of dental sciences , kgmc , lucknow , with the chief complaint of difficulty in brushing the lower anterior teeth both labially and lingually , rotated in lower anteriors , and produced problems in fluent speech . the lingual frenum was thick and fibrotic inserted close to the tip of the tongue . anteriorly , it was continuous with the mandibular labial frenum along the floor of the mouth and between the mandibular central incisors [ figure 1 ] . the tongue showed clefting on the protrusion and typical heart shape on elevating it toward the palate . on pulling the lower lip outwardly , the tongue was inadvertently forced out due to pull exerted by the labial frenum . similarly , on retruding the tongue into the floor of the mouth , the lower lip was strained inward . on forcibly separating the lip and the tongue away from each other , there was spacing between the central incisors and a distolingually rotated lower right central incisor . frenum attachment at the tip of the tongue and insertion into labial lip protracted tongue on outward lip movement frenectomy was done under local anesthesia . using two hemostats , the lingual frenum was clamped and then clipped with a scalpel . the incision was deep enough to sever and remove the intrinsic muscle extension which was enmeshed into the frenum [ figure 2 ] . the labial frenectomy was done in continuation with lingual frenectomy [ figure 2 ] . immediately , after surgery , tongue protrusion of 3 cm was seen . the patient was prescribed analgesics , antibiotics , and mouthwash , instructed for regular tongue exercises for 35 min , once or twice daily , for 34 weeks , and maintaining proper oral hygiene . the healing was smooth , and at a 2-week follow - up , the patient showed improvement in tongue mobility . after 3 years follow - up , the patient showed normal speech and tongue movement [ figure 3 ] . in the oral cavity , frenula are cords of tissue beneath the tongue and in the labial and buccal vestibules , which during the intrauterine development , apparently guide the growth of various structures of the oral apparatus . after birth , they are largely redundant although they seem to help in the positioning of primary teeth . ankyloglossia may be the result of failure in cellular degeneration leading to a much longer anchor between the floor of the mouth and tongue . ankyloglossia , though an innocuous condition , it does mar the normal function of the tongue . although there is ambiguity regarding the definition or grading system to describe tongue - tie , kotlow has suggested a protocol for the diagnosis of the condition which is the most commonly acceptable classification . in the present case , frenum attachment was observed at the tip of the tongue continuous with the mandibular labial frenum along the floor of the mouth and between the mandibular central incisors , attached to the lower lip . thus , the kotlow 's classification must be modified to include it as class 5 type of ankyloglossia . speech problems as the tip of the tongue can not rise high enough to articulate sounds such as  t , d , z , s , th , n , and l  or arch off the floor of the mouth while pronouncing  this promotes an infantile swallow and prevents its conversion into an adult - like swallow which can result in an open - bite deformity or mandibular prognathism due to the tongue contacts the anterior portion of the mandible with exaggerated anterior thrusts . severe ankyloglossia in early age may result in inadequate milk intake , prolonged feeding times , maternal nipple pain or bleeding , and rarely , failure to thrive . personal and social activities as licking ice cream , cleaning food off the teeth with the tongue , playing wind instruments , and kissing are impaired . thus , depending on the extent of tongue movement and hazelbaker scoring system to assess the severity of ankyloglossia , the following treatments are planned . class 1 and class 2 cases are self - correcting ; thus wait and watch along with speech therapy is indicated . delays in language acquisition after frenectomy have been noticed in some young patients , possibly due to habitual lack of practicing a more mature and structured language and an inherent tendency to converse using short phrases and telegraphic speech . the longer these maladaptations have lasted , more the patient will cling to them , and much motivation is required to boost progress toward developing proper oro - motor skills . the patient had developed a good and fluent speech as well as correct wording after speech therapy in 3 years follow - up period . optimal management of tongue - tie including well - timed and proper surgical intervention followed by proper tongue exercises and speech therapy as and when indicated holds the potential to deliver pleasing results in complete ankyloglossia .\",\n",

2014 ) strong arguments for a mid in the presented patient are short stature , ptosis , reduced tendon - reflexes , tremor , anemia , muscle biopsy , and the family history . ptosis is a key phenotypic feature of mids and has been reported in cpeo , merrf , melas , leigh - syndrome , and nonsyndromic mids . anemia is also a typical feature of mids and has been described in pearson - syndrome , kearns - sayre - syndrome , barth - syndrome , mlasa , xlasa , leigh - syndrome , lhon , melas , trma , arsa , but also in nonsyndromic mids . short stature is also a frequent phenotypic feature of mids and has been reported in syndromic ( melas , merrf , midd , leigh - syndrome ) and nonsyndromic mids . weaker arguments include thyroid dysfunction since hormone levels varied frequently and compliance for intake of l - thyroxine was questionable , and migraine , polydipsia , and arterial hypertension since her information about headache , intake of drugs , and blood pressure monitoring was assessed as untrustworthy and since arterial hypertension is not generally accepted as a mid manifestation . though malingering - disorder has been reported only once as a manifestation of a mid , it is well - documented that psychiatric disease is frequently part of the phenotypic spectrum of mids . psychiatric abnormalities have been repeatedly reported in association with mids and include mood disorder ( depression ) , anorexia nervosa , bipolar disorder , obsessive - compulsive disorder , cognitive deterioration , psychosis , anxiety , autism , or confusional state . arguments for malingering - disorder in the presented patient are that she changed her medication frequently , that information about her symptoms and medication was not reliable , that she pretended symptoms , which could not be objectified neither on clinical examination nor on instrumental investigations , that she frequently  produced  psychogenic seizures , resulting in frequent admissions , including intensive care units , and that she accepted painful invasive procedures to get medical attention . an argument for psychogenic seizures was that lactate and prolactine were always normal during or after these events . an argument in favor of epileptic seizures is episodic hyper - ckemia and occasionally paroxysmal eeg activity . whether she was injecting insulin via the port to deliberately produce hypoglycemia , or whether she was carrying out blood drawings via an argument against voluntary blood drawing is that she had anemia long before the port had been implanted and that anemia was a constant phenomenon over years , making it unlikely that she produced it each time before admission . arguments against injecting insulin through the port are that she had these attacks already before 2009 , that there was never severe hypoglycemia on any of the emergency admissions , that insulin and c - peptide were normal , and that she never presented with typical clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia ( temporary tremor , sweating , palpitations , tachycardia , hunger , facial paleness ) at any admission . on one of her numerous admissions , she had hypoglycemia and glibenclamid was in her pocket . a further argument for anemia as part of the phenotype is that she had typical mid manifestations , which she could not imitate . electrolyte disturbances resulted most likely from mild fanconi syndrome ( polyuria , polydipsia , proteinurea , hypophosphatemia , hypoglycemia , and hypouricemia ) . myopathy manifested only as ptosis and easy fatigability , cerebral involvement as epilepsy and malingering - disorder , and endocrine involvement as short stature and thyroid dysfunction . the health system could save costs if patients with psychiatric disease from mids are registered and primarily referred to a department equipped to handle mids , which is admittedly hardly available . in the light of the increasing prevalence of mids , however , institution of departments dedicated particularly to the management of mids would be appreciated , since such units would use their expertise not only for an improved satisfaction of the patient but also for saving public money not only by more specific treatment of these patients but also by relief of the many specialized departments , including neurological departments , to which these patients are referred nowadays but which are frequently overburdened with the diagnosis mid and its plethora of phenotypic expressions . this case shows that mids also manifest with a malingering - disorder but normal cerebral imaging . management of such patients could be difficult for departments not familiar with mids and facilitated and improved if these patients are taken seriously and if they are treated at departments particularly dedicated to the handling of mids .',\n",

       " {'article': 'teratomas are composed of various cell types , which represent more than one germ layer . sacrococcygeal teratoma is the most common solid neoplasm in neonates , with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 35,000 - 40,000 births . they can be diagnosed prenatally by fetal ultrasound ; 50 - 70% of cases are found during the first few days of life , with less than 10% being diagnosed beyond the age of 2 years . complete surgical resection is necessary to alleviate symptoms and to rule out malignancy because malignant transformation has sometimes been reported . almost all reported cases of adult teratomas have been found as a single tumor , so multiple masses are extremely unusual . we report a case of adult teratoma found as multiple tumors in the presacral area . an 18-year - old female was transferred to our outpatient department from a local hospital . a ct scan was performed for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis , and 3 presacral masses were revealed . a regularly marginated mass measuring 5.5 cm was identified in the left retrorectal space and extended into the ischiorectal fossa ( fig . a high - density mass measuring 6 cm was observed in the right retrorectal area . on coronal view , another nodule measuring 3 cm was found just beneath the mass mentioned above ( fig . the 3 masses were contiguously located ; however , all of them were individually circumscribed and were , thus , regarded as independent masses rather than lobulating daughters budding from one mass . no evidence of bone destruction or invasion of the adjacent structures was found . on digital rectal examination human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) and serum markers , alpha - fetoprotein , carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) , and carbohydrate antigens ( ca 19 - 9 , ca 125 ) , were not elevated . the right lower mass showed dense adherence to the sacrum and was filled with sebaceous material and hair . the mass was resected without removal of the coccyx bone although it was adhered to the sacrum . sebaceous material was also aspirated from the cyst in order to obtain a better operative view . all three germ layers appeared in all 3 tumors : fragments of squamous epithelium , hair , sebaceous glands , and neural glia ( ectodermal derivation ) ; adipose tissue and bone ( mesodermal derivation ) ; and respiratory epithelium ( endodermal derivation ) . no malignant or immature cells were found , and a diagnosis of mature cystic teratoma was made . the patient recovered without showing any postoperative complication . teratomas contain tissues that are foreign to their anatomic site and have not resulted from metaplasia . they are derived from embryonic pluripotent cells and may have various degrees of maturation , according to which they are classified as mature , immature , and malignant . they may be inherently malignant or have the potential for malignant degeneration . among the pediatric population , the incidence of malignancy is 7 - 10% when diagnosis is made prior to the age of 2 months , compared with 50 - 67% when the diagnosis is established after that age . however , benign tumors predominate in case reports involving adult populations [ 5 , 6 ] . the possibility of malignancy should be kept in mind when planning the treatment for adult sacrococcygeal or presacral teratomas because cases of malignant transformation have sometimes been reported [ 2 , 5 , 7 ] . with regard to radiologic evaluation , the presence of irregular calcifications has been reported in 75% of benign tumors . calcifications are also found in 25% of malignant teratomas , so they can not be considered to be an indicator of benignity . malignancy is suspected in large tumors with necrosis , poor definition of adjacent soft tissue planes , and sacral infiltration and is certain when locoregional lymph node and distant metastases are noted [ 8 , 9 ] . based on this information , the tumor in the present case was considered to have a benign nature in preoperative evaluation , although imaging features alone do not provide definite differentiation between benign and malignant teratomas . in this case , benignity was confirmed using an intraoperative frozen biopsy . most teratomas contain both solid and cystic areas , although completely solid teratomas do occur . teratomas are usually well - encapsulated single masses , and independently encapsulated cysts can rarely be found within one large tumor . however , the appearance of an adult sacrococcygeal or presacral teratoma as multiple masses is extremely rare , and according to a thorough literature review , only one report has shown a case of presacral teratoma exhibiting three cystic masses . various theories for the origin of teratomas include parthenogenetic development of germ cells within the gonads or in extragonadal sites ; nonparthenogenetic origin from \" wandering \" germ cells left behind during migration of embryonic germ cells from the yolk sac to the gonad ; and an origin from other totipotent embryonic cells . pluripotent cells are normally present in the gonads and may also be found in abnormal sequestered midline embryonic rests . accordingly , teratomas are found in the mediastinum , the retroperitoneal space , the sacrococcygeal zone and intracranial locations , as well as the gonads . if the pathogenesis of sacrococcygeal or presacral teratomas that are aberrantly sequestered pluripotent cells is considered , the presence of multiple tumors might be possible , as in the reported case , which is very unusual . symptoms of presacral teratomas are often subtle and nonspecific ; however , completely asymptomatic patients , like the present case , are rare . most frequently reported symptoms include lower back and pelvic pain , constipation , urinary retention and lower extremity paresthesias or weakness [ 7 , 11 ] . symptoms mainly result from the mass effect and rarely from infiltration in the case of malignancy . , presacral simple cystic lesions may correspond to anterior meningoceles or rectal duplication cysts . in the appropriate clinical context , they may also represent abnormal collections , such as seromas or urinomas . in the presence of a multiloculated cystic lesion more complex lesions may represent chronic retrorectal abscesses , pilonidal or dermoid cysts , soft tissue , bone tumors and metastatic tumors . whatever the nature of the lesion is ct and mri are the most significant methods to characterize the mass and to evaluate the intrapelvic extension and relationship to other structures . both studies are complementary ; however , ct is the most sensitive study for demonstrating calcification and ossification in sacrococcygeal teratomas , as well as for determining the integrity of the adjacent cortical bone . mri allows a better topographic evaluation of the tumor owing to its direct multiplanar characteristics and provides higher resolution in soft tissues . in this case , mri was not performed because the boundary of the mass was clear on the ct scan . however , for a thorough preoperative study in complicated cases , mri could be necessary . surgical excision is the treatment of choice for presacral teratomas , provided that the tumor can be completely removed . a posterior approach through a sacral incision , a transabdominal approach and a combined approach have been reported , depending on the tumor \\'s size and location . recently , laparoscopic excision has also been attempted by some particular surgeons [ 12 , 13 ] . in conclusion , a presacral teratoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass in adults . an adult teratoma at this site can appear as a multiple tumor , although it is extremely unusual .',\n",

rmidpv = right middle pulmonary vein ; rcapv = right caudal pulmonary vein ; lcapv = left caudal pulmonary vein unilateral absence of a pulmonary artery ( uapa ) is a rare congenital cardiovascular anomaly that was first described in humans in 1868 , and in the veterinary literature in 1986 . in 2011 , a review of the human medical literature revealed 419 cases worldwide . there is one documented case of uapa reported in the veterinary literature , in a 2-year - old , siamese cat . additionally , this condition has been suggested in two feline cases of pulmonary artery stenosis . the images presented here represent veterinary examples of cta for the diagnosis of uapa and highlight additional information gained from this modality , including collateral circulation , presence of segmental pulmonary arteries and lung characteristics . in humans , uapa is commonly accompanied by concurrent cardiovascular malformations including tetralogy of fallot , atrial septal defect , coarctation of the aorta , right aortic arch , truncus arteriosus , patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary atresia . left - sided absence is frequently associated with other cardiac malformations , while right - sided absence predominates in isolated cases . the absent pulmonary artery in isolated uapa is almost always contralateral to the aortic arch ( eg , absence of the rpa with a left - sided aortic arch ) . during mammalian embryogenesis , the distal intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries develop from their respective lung buds and join the proximal portion of the right and left sixth aortic arch , which then develop into the left and right extrapulmonary pulmonary arteries . the pt arises from the truncoaortic sac , while the distal right and left sixth aortic arches form the right and left ducti arteriosi . the predominant theory for the development of uapa describes anomalous involution of the proximal sixth aortic arch , while the connection between the intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries and the distal sixth aortic arch persists . the corresponding pulmonary tissues will become hypoxic and ischemic , prompting growth of anomalous collateral vessels to perfuse the affected lung lobes and predisposing these lungs to infection . presenting complaints in people with uapa are variable with recurrent respiratory tract infections , exercise intolerance and mild dyspnea described most frequently ; hemoptysis occurs less commonly . the age at diagnosis in people is variable , with a median of 14 years , ranging from infancy to 58 years . infants may present in respiratory distress , with cyanosis , growth delay , severe ph and congestive heart failure . adults may be asymptomatic ; the disease incidentally diagnosed once thoracic radiographs are performed for other reasons . it has been speculated that the diagnosis can be delayed in humans owing to non - specific presenting signs or because diagnostics are pursued only once respiratory infection or hemoptysis manifest . in humans , thoracic radiographs may reveal asymmetric lung lobe size with a deviated mediastinum toward the affected hemithorax and contralateral lung hyperinflation . the affected lung field is often reduced in size , hyperlucent , with absent or decreased pulmonary vascular markings , smaller intercostal spaces and an elevated hemidiaphragm . in cat 1 , the mediastinal shift away from the affected lung ( toward the left ) was in contrast to the expected findings of a shift to the right . the reason for this is unclear , but may relate to the infiltrate in the left lung lobes of this cat and compensatory hyperinflation of the better aerated right lung lobes . alternatively , intralobar pulmonary sequestration can present with emphysematous changes ; pulmonary sequestration is defined as a portion of lung that does not connect to the tracheobronchial tree and has a systemic arterial supply . as this cat did have a systemic arterial supply to the right lung , it is possible that a portion of the right lung represented pulmonary sequestration with emphysematous change ; however , there was no evidence of pulmonary sequestration or right - sided emphysema noted on post - mortem evaluation . the mediastinal shift had resolved on the follow - up radiographs , but the paradox of emphysematous and hyperinflated left lung lobes on post mortem stands in contrast to the apparent hypoinflation of the left lung on radiographs . an explanation for this discrepancy is challenging , though it is possible that the unilateral emphysema of the left lung resulted in air - trapping and a more prominent size relative to the non - emphysematous right lung at autopsy . the term interstitial pneumonia as noted on this cat s lung histopathology reflects inflammation involving the alveolar or interlobular septa and does not imply an infectious etiology . the radiographs from cat 2 were consistent with human reports showing a shift toward the affected ( right ) lung . a definitive diagnosis in humans can be obtained by performing ct or mri , which can reveal mosaic parenchymal changes , patent segmental pulmonary arteries with variable systemic collateral arterial circulation , and bronchiectasis secondary to recurrent respiratory tract infections . in humans , the anomalous systemic collateral vessels primarily arise from not only the bronchial arteries , but have also been documented to develop from the intercostal , subdiaphragmatic , subclavian and coronary arteries . transthoracic echocardiography is used to confirm the diagnosis , rule out other cardiac or vascular anomalies , and estimate pulmonary arterial pressure . echocardiography may reveal a dilated unilateral pulmonary artery , absence of the contralateral pulmonary artery , ph and right ventricular hypertrophy . while angiography remains the historical gold standard for diagnosis in humans , it is reserved for patients undergoing embolization or revascularization surgery . the previously reported case of uapa in a cat was similar to the two cases described here ; absence of the rpa was documented by non - selective angiography and autopsy evaluation in a 2-year - old siamese with respiratory distress . in the other two feline reports that relate to this condition , flow was not apparent in the lpa during angiography and constriction at the origin of the rpa was additionally noted . while similar to uapa , it is our opinion that these cases represent pulmonary artery stenosis type iia , or juxtaductal constrictions , because of the ostial narrowing at the rpa and post - mortem image showing presence of an occluded lpa from the pt to the left lung . the previously reported siamese case also demonstrated unilateral interstitial infiltrate in the left hemithorax , as in the two cases presented here . the pulmonary infiltrates are of uncertain etiology ; pulmonary edema related to excess blood flow ( total cardiac output traversing half the normal pulmonary vasculature ) is considered given the response to diuretic therapy . respiratory infection , as occurs in humans with this condition , is considered less likely given resolution without antibiotic therapy . angiocardiography has previously characterized the anomaly , though ct appears to be effective for accurate morphologic assessment of the condition , while also allowing improved visualization of the lung parenchyma and systemic collateral vasculature as seen in the two cats described herein . while there has been no consensus on treatment in humans , therapies are typically reserved for those experiencing massive hemoptysis , recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and ph . treatment options in humans have included partial or total pneumonectomy , selective embolization of collateral vessels , ductal stenting and systemic - to - pulmonary artery grafting . pulmonary hypertension in people is treated medically using endothelin receptor antagonists , prostacyclins , phosphodiesterase inhibitors or calcium channel blockers . treatment was attempted for the ph in cat 1 , but did not provide sustained palliation . cat 2 was diagnosed with right - sided uapa without evidence of ph , though mild ph could not be excluded , and has been successfully managed using oral furosemide and angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibition . based on these two cases and the human condition , moderate - to - severe ph may be a negative prognostic factor in cats with uapa . right - sided uapa was diagnosed by cta in two cats , allowing accurate characterization of the arterial malformation , as well as determination of the collateral blood supply to the affected lung . the condition may be suspected by thoracic radiographs and echocardiography in cats having respiratory signs , unilateral pulmonary infiltrates and dilated lobar pulmonary vessels ; confirmation of the diagnosis is provided by cta .',\n",

       " {'article': \"a 5-month - old male child weighing 4 kg , having bilateral microcornea and total cataract , presenting with nystagmus , was planned for lens aspiration and intraocular lens implantation . parents mentioned that the child had a history of recurrent cough ; however , there was no history of hurried breathing , feeding difficulty , cyanosis , or seizures . on examination , the child was found to have cyanosis , clubbing , grade four systolic murmurs in left second intercostal space with room air saturation of 6070% only . in addition to complete hemogram and serum electrolytes , which were within normal limits an echo - cardiogram was done which revealed tof with pulmonary atresia , decreased pulmonary blood flow , large ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) , large patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) , and normal biventricular function . as the patient had presented late , after consultation with the cardiologist the correction of the cataract was deemed more urgent than immediate correction of tof defect . on the day of surgery , the child was prepared as per american society of anesthesiologists ( asa ) fasting guidelines . as per the advice of the cardiologist , the patient received antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous prostaglandin ( pg ) e1 infusion was kept ready to maintain the patency of pda , which could be guided by a fall in hemoglobin saturation below 45% . electrocardiography ( ecg ) , noninvasive blood pressure , o2 saturation , and temperature monitoring were done as per standard asa guidelines . emla cream was applied on the dorsum of left hand for securing iv access to prevent pain leading to crying spell , which could have led to de - saturation . the patient was induced with iv ketamine ( 8 mg ) and mask ventilation with 100% o2 was done . proseal laryngeal mask airway ( lma ) was used to secure the airway as oxygenation and ventilation are as effective as endotracheal intubation with far less hemodynamic changes . maintenance was done with o2 , air , sevoflurane , and iv fentanyl ( 8 ug ) and vecuronium ( 0.4 mg ) was used for its cardiostability . patient 's hemodynamics were stable and saturation was maintained around 6065% throughout the intraoperative period . the child received supplemental o2 and monitored ( spo2 and ecg ) in the postanesthesia care unit for 4 h in an incubator . the child received paracetamol rectal suppository for pain relief . on the first postoperative day , child developed breathing difficulty , fever and increasing cyanosis for which he was shifted to the cardiac intensive care unit ( icu ) and after a week blalock  the child recovered well and was sent home with due instructions . on the first postoperative day and 2 weeks after lens aspiration , the child 's visual axis was clear and was following light . it is characterized by the presence of a vsd aortic overriding , pulmonary artery outflow obstruction and right ventricular hypertrophy . problems associated with tof such as chronic hypoxia , polycythemia , coagulopathy in congestive heart failure , embolism , and altered acid - base status cause significant mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing anesthesia for various surgical procedures . our patient was brought to the hospital for ocular complaints rather than cardiac manifestations primarily because of unawareness of the uneducated parents . the decision to correct the ocular problem first was based on an attempt to prevent any further visual loss in the child . reversibility of amblyopia depends on the stage of maturity of the visual system at which the abnormal visual experience began , the duration of deprivation , and the age at which therapy was instituted . if amblyopia is not managed properly , visual deprivation during this period usually causes severe and permanent visual loss and permanent nystagmus . if visual deprivation occurs after the age of 23 months , amblyopia is usually reversible to some extent . visual loss and the development of amblyopia are also dependent on the size and location of the cataract . as in this patient the visual evoked response in this child showed delayed latency of 132 ms in right eye and 136 ms in the left eye . hence , despite having cyanotic heart disease , early lens aspiration was preferred than cardiac shunt surgery to prevent irreversible amblyopia . we preferred iv induction with ketamine in order to maintain systemic vascular resistance and flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery . maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane in oxygen and air with a minimum alveolar concentration of 0.9 - 1 provided stable hemodynamics . saturation remained more than 60 throughout , and so pg was not required intra - operatively . the child developing fever , breathing difficulty , and increasing cyanosis 24 h after surgery could be because of dehydration as the child was only on oral fluids . infective endocarditis could also be a cause due to a minor injury during manipulation of the airway and lma placement could have also resulted in migration of bacteria into the bloodstream . the fever could also be due to the physiological response to surgery . the urgency of preventing irreversible amblyopia in the child lead us to carefully plan and manage anesthesia in this child prior to correction of cardiac defect . postoperative problems which occurred in this child indicate the need of intensive monitoring and keeping a standby cardiac set up for if the need arises in the postoperative period . in tetralogy of fallot patients with severe compromised cardiac functions , noncardiac surgeries can be undertaken with necessary precautions . pediatric ophthalmologic surgeries which have a definite time period for correction should not be delayed whenever possible .\",\n",
